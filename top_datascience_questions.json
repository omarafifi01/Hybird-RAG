    "body": "<p>I recently read <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4038\">Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation</a> by Jonathan Long, Evan Shelhamer, Trevor Darrell. I don't understand what \"deconvolutional layers\" do / how they work.</p>\n\n<p>The relevant part is</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>3.3. Upsampling is backwards strided convolution</p>\n  \n  <p>Another way to connect coarse outputs to dense pixels\n  is interpolation. For instance, simple bilinear interpolation\n  computes each output $y_{ij}$ from the nearest four inputs by a\n  linear map that depends only on the relative positions of the\n  input and output cells.<br/>\n  In a sense, upsampling with factor $f$ is convolution with\n  a fractional input stride of 1/f. So long as $f$ is integral, a\n  natural way to upsample is therefore backwards convolution\n  (sometimes called deconvolution) with an output stride of\n  $f$. Such an operation is trivial to implement, since it simply\n  reverses the forward and backward passes of convolution.<br/>\n  Thus upsampling is performed in-network for end-to-end\n  learning by backpropagation from the pixelwise loss.<br/>\n  Note that the deconvolution filter in such a layer need not\n  be fixed (e.g., to bilinear upsampling), but can be learned.\n  A stack of deconvolution layers and activation functions can\n  even learn a nonlinear upsampling.<br/>\n  In our experiments, we find that in-network upsampling\n  is fast and effective for learning dense prediction. Our best\n  segmentation architecture uses these layers to learn to upsample\n  for refined prediction in Section 4.2.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don't think I really understood how convolutional layers are trained. </p>\n\n<p>What I think I've understood is that convolutional layers with a kernel size $k$ learn filters of size $k \\times k$. The output of a convolutional layer with kernel size $k$, stride $s \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and $n$ filters is of dimension $\\frac{\\text{Input dim}}{s^2} \\cdot n$. However, I don't know how the learning of convolutional layers works. (I understand how simple MLPs learn with gradient descent, if that helps).</p>\n\n<p>So if my understanding of convolutional layers is correct, I have no clue how this can be reversed.</p>\n\n<p>Could anybody please help me to understand deconvolutional layers?</p>\n"

For example, a large gradient flowing through a ReLU neuron\n  could cause the weights to update in such a way that the neuron will\n  never activate on any datapoint again.

That is, the ReLU units can irreversibly die during training since\n  they can get knocked off the data manifold. For example, you may find\n  that as much as 40% of your network can be \"dead\" (i.e. neurons that\n  never activate across the entire training dataset) if the learning\n  rate is set too high. With a proper setting of the learning rate this\n  is less frequently an issue.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What does dying of neurons here mean? </p>\n\n<p>Could you please provide an intuitive explanation in simpler terms.</p>\n"

This would result in:</p>\n\n<p>$\\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{i=1}^mh_\\theta(x^{(i)})-y^{(i)}$</p>\n\n<p>But this is not what has been suggested. Instead the course suggests to take the square value of the difference, and to multiply by $\\frac{1}{2m}$. So the formula is:</p>\n\n<p>$\\frac{1}{2m}\\sum_{i=1}^m(h_\\theta(x^{(i)})-y^{(i)})^2$</p>\n\n<p>Why is that? Why do we use the square function here, and why do we multiply by $\\frac{1}{2m}$ instead of $\\frac{1}{m}$?</p>\n"

    "body": "<p>This is a small conceptual question that's been nagging me for a while: How can we back-propagate through a max-pooling layer in a neural network?</p>\n\n<p>I came across max-pooling layers while going through <a href=\"https://github.com/soumith/cvpr2015/blob/master/Deep%20Learning%20with%20Torch.ipynb\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this tutorial</a> for Torch 7's nn library. The library abstracts the gradient calculation and forward passes for each layer of a deep network. I don't understand how the gradient calculation is done for a max-pooling layer.</p>\n\n<p>I know that if you have an input ${z_i}^l$ going into neuron $i$ of layer $l$, then ${\\delta_i}^l$ (defined as ${\\delta_i}^l = \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial {z_i}^l}$) is given by:\n$$\n{\\delta_i}^l = \\theta^{'}({z_i}^l) \\sum_{j} {\\delta_j}^{l+1} w_{i,j}^{l,l+1}\n$$</p>\n\n<p>So, a max-pooling layer would receive the ${\\delta_j}^{l+1}$'s of the next layer as usual; but since the activation function for the max-pooling neurons takes in a vector of values (over which it maxes) as input, ${\\delta_i}^{l}$ isn't a single number anymore, but a vector ($\\theta^{'}({z_j}^l)$ would have to be replaced by $\\nabla \\theta(\\left\\{{z_j}^l\\right\\})$). Furthermore, $\\theta$, being the max function, isn't differentiable with respect to it's inputs. </p>\n\n<p>So....how should it work out exactly?</p>\n"

So far I have come across two models:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/lstm.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">LSTM</a> (long short term memory; a class of recurrent neural networks)</li>\n<li>ARIMA</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I have tried both and read some articles on them. Now I am trying to get a better sense on how to compare the two. What I have found so far:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>LSTM works better if we are dealing with huge amount of data and enough training data is available, while ARIMA is better for smaller datasets (is this correct?)</li>\n<li>ARIMA requires a series of parameters <code>(p,q,d)</code> which must be calculated based on data, while LSTM does not require setting such parameters. However, there are some hyperparameters we need to tune for LSTM.</li>\n<li><strong>EDIT:</strong> One major difference between the two that I noticed while reading a great article <a href=\"http://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/02/time-series-forecasting-codes-python/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>, is that ARIMA could only perform well on stationary time series (where there is no seasonality, trend and etc.) and you need to take care of that if want to use ARIMA</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Other than the above-mentioned properties, I could not find any other points or facts which could help me toward selecting the best model. I would be really grateful if someone could help me finding articles, papers or other stuff (had no luck so far, only some general opinions here and there and nothing based on experiments.)</p>\n\n<p>I have to mention that originally I am dealing with streaming data, however for now I am using <a href=\"https://github.com/numenta/NAB\" rel=\"noreferrer\">NAB datasets</a> which includes 50 datasets with the maximum size of 20k data points.</p>\n"

    "body": "<p>I recently read <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/yann.lecun/posts/10152820758292143\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yan LeCuns comment on 1x1 convolutions</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>In Convolutional Nets, there is no such thing as &quot;fully-connected layers&quot;. There are only convolution layers with 1x1 convolution kernels and a full connection table.</strong></p>\n<p>It's a too-rarely-understood fact that ConvNets don't need to have a fixed-size input.</p>\n<p>You can train them on inputs that happen to produce a single output vector (with no spatial extent), and then apply them to larger images.</p>\n<p>Instead of a single output vector, you then get a spatial map of output vectors.  Each vector sees input windows at different locations on the input.\n<strong>In that scenario, the &quot;fully connected layers&quot; really act as 1x1 convolutions.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I would like to see a simple example for this.</p>\n<h2>Example</h2>\n<p>Assume you have a fully connected network. It has only an input layer and an\noutput layer. The input layer has 3 nodes, the output layer has 2 nodes. This\nnetwork has <span class=\"math-container\">$3 \\cdot 2 = 6$</span> parameters. To make it even more concrete, lets say you have a ReLU activation function in the output layer and the weight matrix</p>\n<p><span class=\"math-container\">$$\n\\begin{align}\nW &amp;= \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\\\\n 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 5\\\\\n\\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2 \\times 3}\\\\\nb &amp;= \\begin{pmatrix}8\\\\ 13\\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mathbb{R}^2\n\\end{align}\n$$</span></p>\n<p>So the network is <span class=\"math-container\">$f(x) = ReLU(W \\cdot x + b)$</span> with <span class=\"math-container\">$x \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$</span>.</p>\n<p><strong>How would the convolutional layer have to look like to be the same? What does LeCun mean with &quot;full connection table&quot;?</strong></p>\n<p>I guess to get an equivalent CNN it would have to have exactly the same number of parameters. The MLP from above has <span class=\"math-container\">$2 \\cdot 3 + 2 = 8$</span> parameters.</p>\n"

Furthermore, the Python port <a href=\"https://github.com/nicolasmiller/pyculiarity\" rel=\"noreferrer\">pyculiarity</a> seems to cause issues in implementing in Windows environment for me.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Skyline, my next attempt, seems to have been pretty much discontinued (from <a href=\"https://github.com/etsy/skyline/issues/119\" rel=\"noreferrer\">github issues</a>).

I have yet to confirm, but should be another useful tool for the community.</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT [2016-01-19]</strong>\nA minor update. I had not time to work on this and research, but I am taking a step back to understand the fundamentals of this problem before continuing to research in specific details. For example, two concrete steps that I am taking are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Starting with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomaly_detection\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Wikipedia articles for anomaly detection</a>, understanding fully, and then either moving up or down in concept hierarchy of other linked Wikipedia articles, such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this</a>, and then <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Exploring techniques in the great surveys done by Chandola et al 2009 <a href=\"http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/%7Ebanerjee/papers/09/anomaly.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Anomaly Detection: A Survey</em></a> and Hodge et al 2004 <a href=\"http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/767/1/hodgevj4.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>A Survey of Outlier Detection Methodologies</em></a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once the concepts are better understood (I hope to play around with toy examples as I go to develop the practical side as well), I hope to understand which open source Python tools are better suited for my problems.</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT [2020-02-04]</strong>\nIt has been a few years since I worked on this problem, and am no longer working on this project, so I will not be following or researching this area until further notice. Thank you very much to all for their input. I hope this discussion helps others that need guidance on anomaly detection work.</p>\n<p>FWIW, if I had to do the same project now with the same resources (few thousand USD in expenses), I would pursue the deep learning/neural network approach. The ability of the method to automatically learn structure and hierarchy via hidden layers would've been very appealing since we had lots of data and (now) could spend the money on cloud compute. I would still use Python though ;).</p>\n<p>Cheers!</p>\n"

    "body": "<p>This question is in response to a comment I saw on another question.</p>\n<p>The comment was regarding the Machine Learning course syllabus on Coursera, and along the lines of &quot;SVMs are not used so much nowadays&quot;.</p>\n<p>I have only just finished the relevant lectures myself, and my understanding of SVMs is that they are a robust and efficient learning algorithm for classification, and that when using a kernel, they have a &quot;niche&quot; covering number of features perhaps 10 to 1000 and number of training samples perhaps 100 to 10,000. The limit on training samples is because the core algorithm revolves around optimising results generated from a square matrix with dimensions based on number of training samples, not number of original features.</p>\n<p>So does the comment I saw refer some real change since the course was made, and if so, what is that change: A new algorithm that covers SVM's &quot;sweet spot&quot; just as well, better CPUs meaning SVM's computational advantages are not worth as much? Or is it perhaps opinion or personal experience of the commenter?</p>\n<p>I tried a search for e.g. &quot;are support vector machines out of fashion&quot; and found nothing to imply they were being dropped in favour of anything else.</p>\n<p>And Wikipedia has this: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine#Issues\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine#Issues</a> . . . the main sticking point appears to be difficulty of interpreting the model. Which makes SVM fine for a black-box predicting engine, but not so good for generating insights. I don't see that as a major issue, just another minor thing to take into account when picking the right tool for the job (along with nature of the training data and learning task etc).</p>\n"

    "body": "<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17187507/why-use-softmax-as-opposed-to-standard-normalization\">Why use softmax as opposed to standard normalization?</a> In the comment area of the top answer of this question, @Kilian Batzner raised 2 questions which also confuse me a lot. It seems no one gives an explanation except numerical benefits.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I get the reasons for using Cross-Entropy Loss, but how does that relate to the softmax? You said &quot;the softmax function can be seen as trying to minimize the cross-entropy between the predictions and the truth&quot;. Suppose, I would use standard / linear normalization, but still use the Cross-Entropy Loss. Then I would also try to minimize the Cross-Entropy. So how is the softmax linked to the Cross-Entropy except for the numerical benefits?</p>\n<p>As for the probabilistic view: what is the motivation for looking at log probabilities? The reasoning seems to be a bit like &quot;We use e^x in the softmax, because we interpret x as log-probabilties&quot;. With the same reasoning we could say, we use e^e^e^x in the softmax, because we interpret x as log-log-log-probabilities (Exaggerating here, of course). I get the numerical benefits of softmax, but what is the theoretical motivation for using it?</p>\n</blockquote>\n"

I know <code>svn</code> and <code>git</code> fairly well and come to value a project history, combined with the ability to easily work together and have protection against disk corruption. I find <code>git</code> also extremely helpful for having consistent backups but I know that git cannot handle large amounts of binary data efficiently.</p>\n\n<p>In my masters studies I worked on data sets of similar size (also images) and had a lot of problems keeping track of different version on different servers/devices. Diffing 100GB over the network really isn't fun, and cost me a lot of time and effort.</p>\n\n<p>I know that others in science seem to have similar problems, yet I couldn't find a good solution.</p>\n\n<p>I want to use the storage facilities of my institute, so I need something that can use a \"dumb\" server. I also would like to have an additional backup on a portable hard disk, because I would like to avoid transferring hundreds of GB over the network wherever possible. So, I need a tool that can handle more than one remote location.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, I really need something that other researcher can use, so it does not need to be super simple, but should be learnable in a few hours.</p>\n\n<p>I have evaluated a lot of different solutions, but none seem to fit the bill:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://subversion.apache.org/\">svn</a> is somewhat inefficient and needs a smart server</li>\n<li>hg <a href=\"http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/BigfilesExtension\">bigfile</a>/<a href=\"http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/LargefilesExtension\">largefile</a> can only use one remote</li>\n<li>git <a href=\"https://github.com/beenje/git-bigfile\">bigfile</a>/<a href=\"https://github.com/alebedev/git-media\">media</a> can also use only one remote, but is also not very efficient</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://attic-backup.org/\">attic</a> doesn't seem to have a log, or diffing capabilities</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://bup.github.io/\">bup</a> looks really good, but needs a \"smart\" server to work</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I've tried <code>git-annex</code>, which does everything I need it to do (and much more), but it is very difficult to use and not well documented. I've used it for several days and couldn't get my head around it, so I doubt any other coworker would be interested.</p>\n\n<p>How do researchers deal with large datasets, and what are other research groups using?</p>\n\n<p>To be clear, I am primarily interested in how other researchers deal with this situation, not just this specific dataset. It seems to me that almost everyone should have this problem, yet I don't know anyone who has solved it. Should I just keep a backup of the original data and forget all this version control stuff? Is that what everyone else is doing?</p>\n"

What if the\n  performance actually deteriorates?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For example, let us assume a case where the model scores around 65% in classifying the testing subset. This could mean that either the model is trained insufficiently OR that the testing subset consists of outliers. In the latter case, training the final model with them would decrease its performance and you find out only after deploying it. </p>\n\n<p>Re-phrasing my initial question:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If you had a <strong>one-time demonstration of a model</strong>, such as deploying it\n  on embedded electronics on-board an expensive rocket experiment, would you trust a\n  model that has been re-trained with the test subset in the final step without being\n  re-tested on its new performance?</p>\n</blockquote>\n"

There are ~50 input features and ~10 output classes. The NN has sigmoid neurons and all data are normalized to [0,1]. I tried lots of different configurations: number of hidden layers and neurons in them (100->100->100, 60->60->60, 60->30->15, etc.), different learning and pre-train rates, etc.</p>\n\n<p>And the best thing I can get is a 20% error rate on the validation set and a 40% error rate on the test set.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, when I try to use Random Forest (from scikit-learn) I easily get a 12% error rate on the validation set and 25%(!) on the test set.</p>\n\n<p>How can it be that my deep NN with pre-training behaves so badly?

    "title": "Neural networks: which cost function to use?",
    "body": "<p>I am using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TensorFlow\">TensorFlow</a> for experiments mainly with neural networks. Although I have done quite some experiments (XOR-Problem, MNIST, some Regression stuff, ...) now, I struggle with choosing the \"correct\" cost function for specific problems because overall I could be considered a beginner.</p>\n\n<p>Before coming to TensorFlow I coded some fully-connected MLPs and some recurrent networks on my own with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)\">Python</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NumPy\">NumPy</a> but mostly I had problems where a simple squared error and a simple gradient descient was sufficient.</p>\n\n<p>However, since TensorFlow offers quite a lot of cost functions itself as well as building custom cost functions, I would like to know if there is some kind of tutorial maybe specifically for cost functions on neural networks? (I've already done like half of the official TensorFlow tutorials but they're not really explaining <strong>why</strong> specific cost functions or learners are used for specific problems - at least not for beginners)</p>\n\n<p><strong>To give some examples:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>cost = tf.reduce_mean(tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(y_output, y_train))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I guess it applies the softmax function on both inputs so that the sum of one vector equals 1. But what exactly is cross entropy with logits? I thought it sums up the values and calculates the cross entropy...so some metric measurement?! Wouldn't this be very much the same if I normalize the output, sum it up and take the squared error?\nAdditionally, why is this used e.g. for MNIST (or even much harder problems)? When I want to classify like 10 or maybe even 1000 classes, doesn't summing up the values completely destroy any information about <em>which</em> class actually was the output?</p>\n\n<p><code>cost = tf.nn.l2_loss(vector)</code></p>\n\n<p>What is this for? I thought l2 loss is pretty much the squared error but TensorFlow's API tells that it's input is just one tensor. Doesn't get the idea at all?!</p>\n\n<p>Besides I saw this for <strong>cross entropy</strong> pretty often:</p>\n\n<pre><code>cross_entropy = -tf.reduce_sum(y_train * tf.log(y_output))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>...but why is this used? Isn't the loss in cross entropy mathematically this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>-1/n * sum(y_train * log(y_output) + (1 - y_train) * log(1 - y_output))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Where is the <code>(1 - y_train) * log(1 - y_output)</code> part in most TensorFlow examples? Isn't it missing?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Answers:</strong> I know this question is quite open, but I do not expect to get like 10 pages with every single problem/cost function listed in detail. I just need a short summary about when to use which cost function (in general or in TensorFlow, doesn't matter much to me) and some explanation about this topic. And/or some source(s) for beginners ;)</p>\n"

    "body": "<p>This question boils down to \"how do convolution layers <em>exactly</em> work.</p>\n\n<p>Suppose I have an $n \\times m$ greyscale image. So the image has one channel.\nIn the first layer, I apply a $3\\times 3$ convolution with $k_1$ filters and padding. Then I have another convolution layer with $5 \\times 5$ convolutions and $k_2$ filters. How many feature maps do I have?</p>\n\n<h2>Type 1 convolution</h2>\n\n<p>The first layer gets executed. After that, I have $k_1$ feature maps (one for each filter). Each of those has the size $n \\times m$. Every single pixel was created by taking $3 \\cdot 3 = 9$ pixels from the padded input image.</p>\n\n<p>Then the second layer gets applied. Every single filter gets applied separately to <strong>each of the feature maps</strong>. This results in $k_2$ feature maps for every of the $k_1$ feature maps. So there are $k_1 \\times k_2$ feature maps after the second layer. Every single pixel of each of the new feature maps got created by taking $5 \\cdot 5 = 25$ \"pixels\" of the padded feature map from before.</p>\n\n<p>The system has to learn $k_1 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 + k_2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 5$ parameters.</p>\n\n<h2>Type 2.1 convolution</h2>\n\n<p>Like before: The first layer gets executed. After that, I have $k_1$ feature maps (one for each filter). Each of those has the size $n \\times m$. Every single pixel was created by taking $3 \\cdot 3 = 9$ pixels from the padded input image.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike before: Then the second layer gets applied. Every single filter gets applied to the same region, but <strong>all feature maps</strong> from before. This results in $k_2$ feature maps in total after the second layer got executed. Every single pixel of each of the new feature maps got created by taking $k_2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 5 = 25 \\cdot k_2$ \"pixels\" of the padded feature maps from before.</p>\n\n<p>The system has to learn $k_1 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 + k_2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 5$ parameters.</p>\n\n<h2>Type 2.2 convolution</h2>\n\n<p>Like above, but instead of having $5 \\cdot 5 = 25$ parameters per filter which have to be learned and get simply copied for the other input feature maps, you have $k_1 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 + k_2 \\cdot k_1 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 5$ paramters which have to be learned.</p>\n\n<h2>Question</h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Is type 1 or type 2 typically used?</li>\n<li>Which type is used in <a href=\"http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fritz/absps/imagenet.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Alexnet</a>?</li>\n<li>Which type is used in <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4842\" rel=\"noreferrer\">GoogLeNet</a>?\n\n<ul>\n<li>If you say type 1: Why do $1 \\times 1$ convolutions make any sense? Don't they only multiply the data with a constant?</li>\n<li>If you say type 2: Please explain the quadratic cost (\"For example, in a deep vision network, if two convolutional layers are chained,\nany uniform increase in the number of their filters results in a quadratic increase of computation\")</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>For all answers, please give some evidence (papers, textbooks, documentation of frameworks) that your answer is correct.</p>\n\n<h2>Bonus question 1</h2>\n\n<p>Is the pooling applied always only per feature map or is it also done over multiple feature maps?</p>\n\n<h2>Bonus question 2</h2>\n\n<p>I'm relatively sure that type 1 is correct and I got something wrong with the GoogLe paper. But there a 3D convolutions, too. Lets say you have 1337 feature maps of size $42 \\times 314$ and you apply a $3 \\times 4 \\times 5$ filter. How do you slide the filter over the feature maps? (Left to right, top to bottom, first feature map to last feature map?) Does it matter as long as you do it consistantly?</p>\n\n<h2>My research</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I've read the two papers from above, but I'm still not sure what is used.</li>\n<li>I've read the <a href=\"http://lasagne.readthedocs.org/en/latest/modules/layers/conv.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">lasagne documentation</a></li>\n<li>I've read the <a href=\"http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/library/tensor/nnet/conv.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">theano documentation</a></li>\n<li>I've read the answers on <a href=\"https://stats.stackexchange.com/q/85767/25741\">Understanding convolutional neural networks</a> (without following all links)</li>\n<li>I've read <a href=\"http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/lenet.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Convolutional Neural Networks (LeNet)</a>.

Consequently, these methods, unlike our algorithm, are\n  too inefficient to be used successfully with large neural networks. We\n  parameterize an approximate value function <span class=\"math-container\">$Q(s, a; \\theta_i)$</span> using the deep\n  convolutional neural network shown in Fig. 1, in which <span class=\"math-container\">$\\theta_i$</span> are the parameters (that is, weights) of the Q-network at iteration <span class=\"math-container\">$i$</span>. To perform\n  experience replay, we store the agent's experiences <span class=\"math-container\">$e_t = (s_t, a_t, r_t, s_{t+1})$</span> at each time-step <span class=\"math-container\">$t$</span> in a data set <span class=\"math-container\">$D_t = \\{e_1, \\dots, e_t \\}$</span>. During learning, we apply Q-learning updates, on samples (or mini-batches) of experience <span class=\"math-container\">$(s, a, r, s') \\sim U(D)$</span>, drawn uniformly at random from the pool of stored samples. The Q-learning update at iteration <span class=\"math-container\">$i$</span> uses the following loss\n  function: </p>\n  \n  <p><span class=\"math-container\">$$\nL_i(\\theta_i) = \\mathbb{E}_{(s, a, r, s') \\sim U(D)} \\left[ \\left(r + \\gamma \\max_{a'} Q(s', a'; \\theta_i^-) - Q(s, a; \\theta_i)\\right)^2 \\right]\n$$</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What is experience replay, and what are its benefits, in laymen's terms?</p>\n"

    "title": "How can I transform names in a confidential data set to make it anonymous, but preserve some of the characteristics of the names?",
    "body": "<h1>Motivation</h1>\n<p>I work with datasets that contain personally identifiable information (PII) and sometimes need to share part of a dataset with third parties, in a way that doesn't expose PII and subject my employer to liability. Our usual approach here is to withhold data entirely, or in some cases to reduce its resolution; e.g., replacing an exact street address with the corresponding county or census tract.</p>\n<p>This means that certain types of analysis and processing must be done in-house, even when a third party has resources and expertise more suited to the task. Since the source data is not disclosed, the way we go about this analysis and processing lacks transparency. As a result, any third party's ability to perform QA/QC, adjust parameters or make refinements may be very limited.</p>\n<h1>Anonymizing Confidential Data</h1>\n<p>One task involves identifying individuals by their names, in user-submitted data, while taking into account errors and inconsistencies. A private individual might be recorded in one place as &quot;Dave&quot; and in another as &quot;David,&quot; commercial entities can have many different abbreviations, and there are always some typos. I've developed scripts based on a number of criteria that determine when two records with non-identical names represent the same individual, and assign them a common ID.</p>\n<p>At this point we can make the dataset anonymous by withholding the names and replacing them with this personal ID number. But this means the recipient has almost no information about e.g. the strength of the match. We would prefer to be able to pass along as much information as possible without divulging identity.</p>\n<h1>What Doesn't Work</h1>\n<p>For instance, it would be great to be able to encrypt strings while preserving edit distance. This way, third parties could do some of their own QA/QC, or choose to do further processing on their own, without ever accessing (or being able to potentially reverse-engineer) PII. Perhaps we match strings in-house with edit distance &lt;= 2, and the recipient wants to look at the implications of tightening that tolerance to edit distance &lt;= 1.</p>\n<p>But the only method I am familiar with that does this is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ROT13</a> (more generally, any <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">shift cipher</a>), which hardly even counts as encryption; it's like writing the names upside down and saying, &quot;Promise you won't flip the paper over?&quot;</p>\n<p>Another <strong>bad</strong> solution would be to abbreviate everything. &quot;Ellen Roberts&quot; becomes &quot;ER&quot; and so forth. This is a poor solution because in some cases the initials, in association with public data, will reveal a person's identity, and in other cases it's too ambiguous; &quot;Benjamin Othello Ames&quot; and &quot;Bank of America&quot; will have the same initials, but their names are otherwise dissimilar. So it doesn't do either of the things we want.</p>\n<p>An inelegant alternative is to introduce additional fields to track certain attributes of the name, e.g.:</p>\n<pre><code>+-----+----+-------------------+-----------+--------+\n| Row | ID | Name              | WordChars | Origin |\n+-----+----+-------------------+-----------+--------+\n| 1   | 17 | &quot;AMELIA BEDELIA&quot;  | (6, 7)    | Eng    |\n+-----+----+-------------------+-----------+--------+\n| 2   | 18 | &quot;CHRISTOPH BAUER&quot; | (9, 5)    | Ger    |\n+-----+----+-------------------+-----------+--------+\n| 3   | 18 | &quot;C J BAUER&quot;       | (1, 1, 5) | Ger    |\n+-----+----+-------------------+-----------+--------+\n| 4   | 19 | &quot;FRANZ HELLER&quot;    | (5, 6)    | Ger    |\n+-----+----+-------------------+-----------+--------+\n</code></pre>\n<p>I call this &quot;inelegant&quot; because it requires anticipating which qualities might be interesting and it's relatively coarse. If the names are removed, there's not much you can reasonably conclude about the strength of the match between rows 2 &amp; 3, or about the distance between rows 2 &amp; 4 (i.e., how close they are to matching).</p>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>The goal is to transform strings in such a way that as many useful qualities of the original string are preserved as possible while obscuring the original string. Decryption should be impossible, or so impractical as to be effectively impossible, no matter the size of the data set. In particular, a method that preserves the edit distance between arbitrary strings would be very useful.</p>\n<p>I've found a couple papers that might be relevant, but they're a bit over my head:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.merl.com/publications/docs/TR2010-109.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Privacy Preserving String Comparisons Based on Levenshtein Distance</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&amp;type=pdf&amp;doi=2889272a345601e5bfecd174c341f54af08811aa\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">An Empirical Comparison of Approaches to Approximate String\nMatching in Private Record Linkage</a></li>\n</ul>\n"

Sure enough, that is indeed right.

What I usually do is just start with one (e.g. standard SGD) and then try other others pretty much randomly. I was wondering if there's a better (and less random) approach to finding a good optimizer, e.g. from this list:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>SGD (with or without momentum)</li>\n<li>AdaDelta</li>\n<li>AdaGrad</li>\n<li>RMSProp</li>\n<li>Adam</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In particular, I am interested if there's some theoretical justification for picking one over another given the training data has some property, e.g. it being sparse. I would also imagine that some optimizers work better than others in specific domains, e.g. when training convolutional networks vs. feed-forward networks or classification vs. regression.</p>\n\n<p>If any of you have developed some strategy and/or intuition on how you pick optimizers, I'd be greatly interested in hearing it.

It's from 2014):</p>\n\n<p>\"...Most network card[s] only work with memory that is registered with the CPU and so the GPU to GPU transfer between two nodes would be like this: GPU 1 to CPU 1 to Network Card 1 to Network Card 2 to CPU 2 to GPU 2. What this means is, if one chooses a slow network card then there might be no speedups over a single computer. Even with fast network cards, if the cluster is large, one does not even get speedups from GPUs when compared to CPUs as the GPUs just work too fast for the network cards to keep up with them.</p>\n\n<p>This is the reason why many big companies like Google and Microsoft are using CPU rather than GPU clusters to train their big neural networks. \"</p>\n\n<p>So at some point, according to this post, it could have been faster to use CPUs. Is this still the case?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT 2: Yes, that blog post may very well be outdated because:</p>\n\n<p>Now it seems that GPUs within a node are connected via PCIe bus, so communication can happen at about 6GiB/s. (For example: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el1iSlP1uOs\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el1iSlP1uOs</a>, about 35 minutes in). The speaker implies that this is faster than going from GPU1 to CPU to GPU2. It would mean the network card is no longer the bottleneck.</p>\n"

For the VOC2007 challenge, the interpolated\naverage precision (Salton and Mcgill 1986) was used to evaluate both\nclassification and detection.

Precision is the proportion of all examples above\nthat rank which are from the positive class. The AP summarises the\nshape of the precision/recall curve, and is defined as the mean\nprecision at a set of eleven equally spaced recall levels\n[0,0.1,...,1]:\n<code>AP = 1/11 ∑ r∈{0,0.1,...,1} pinterp(r)</code></p>\n<p>The precision at each recall level r is interpolated by taking the\nmaximum precision measured for a method for which the corresponding\nrecall exceeds r: <code>pinterp(r) = max p(r˜)</code>, where p(r˜) is the measured\nprecision at recall ˜r</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>About <a href=\"http://0agr.ru/wiki/index.php/Precision_and_Recall#Average_Precision\" rel=\"noreferrer\">mAP</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>So does it mean that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We <strong>calculate Precision and Recall</strong>:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><p>A) For <strong>many different <code>IoU</code></strong> <code>&gt; {0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1}</code> we calculate True/False Positive/Negative values</p>\n<p>Where <code>True positive = Number_of_detection with IoU &gt; {0, 0.1,..., 1}</code>, as said <a href=\"https://datascience.stackexchange.com/a/16813/98307\">here</a> and then we calculate:</p>\n<p><code>Precision = True positive / (True positive + False positive)</code></p>\n<p><code>Recall = True positive / (True positive + False negative)</code></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<ul>\n<li><p>B) Or for <strong>many different thresholds</strong> of detection algorithms we calculate:</p>\n<p><code>Precision = True positive / (True positive + False positive)</code></p>\n<p><code>Recall = True positive / (True positive + False negative)</code></p>\n<p>Where <code>True positive = Number_of_detection with IoU &gt; 0.5</code> as said <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/43168882/9214357\">here</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<ul>\n<li><p>C) Or for <strong>many different thresholds</strong> of detection algorithms we calculate:</p>\n<p><code>Precision = Intersect / Detected_box</code></p>\n<p><code>Recall = Intersect / Object</code></p>\n<p>As shown <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>?\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/JlHnn.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/JlHnn.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Then we <strong>build Precision-Recall curve</strong>, as shown here:\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Br0IM.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Br0IM.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></li>\n</ol>\n<hr />\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Then we calculate AP (average precision) as <strong>average of 11 values of <code>Precision</code></strong> at the points where <code>Recall = {0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1}</code>, i.e. <code>AP = 1/11 ∑ recall∈{0,0.1,...,1} Precision(Recall)</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p>(In general for each point, for example 0.3, we get MAX of Precision for Recall &lt;= 0.3, instead of value of Precision at this point Recall=0.3)</p>\n<hr />\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>And when we calculate AP only for 1 something object class on all images - then we get <strong>AP (average precision)</strong> for this class, for example, only for <code>air</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So AP is a  integral (<a href=\"https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/157019\">area under the curve</a>)</p>\n<p>But when we calculate AP for all object classes on all images - then we get <strong>mAP (mean average precision)</strong> for all images dataset.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Is it right, and if it isn't, then how to calculate mAP for Pascal VOC Challenge?</li>\n<li>And which of the 3 formulas (A, B or C) is correct for calculating Precision and Recall, in paragraph 1?</li>\n</ol>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Short answer:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>mAP = AVG(AP for each object class)</li>\n<li>AP = AVG(Precision for each of 11 Recalls {precision = 0, 0.1, ..., 1})</li>\n<li>PR-curve = Precision and Recall (for each Threshold that is in the Predictions bound-boxes)</li>\n<li>Precision = TP / (TP + FP)</li>\n<li>Recall = TP / (TP + FN)</li>\n<li>TP = number of detections with IoU&gt;0.5</li>\n<li>FP = number of detections with IoU&lt;=0.5 or detected more than once</li>\n<li>FN = number of objects that not detected or detected with IoU&lt;=0.5</li>\n</ul>\n"

There's also <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/udibr/7f46e790c9e342d75dcbd9b1deb9d940\">an implementation of it</a> on Keras.</p>\n\n<p>But I remember there are papers titled <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09025\">Recurrent Batch Normalization</a> (Cooijmans, 2016) and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.01378\">Batch Normalized Recurrent Neural Networks</a> (Laurent, 2015). What's the difference between those three?</p>\n\n<p>There is this Related Work section I don't understand:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Batch normalization has been previously extended to recurrent neural networks [Laurent et al., 2015, Amodei et al., 2015, Cooijmans et al., 2016]. The previous work [Cooijmans et al., 2016] suggests the best performance of recurrent batch normalization is obtained by keeping independent normalization statistics for each time-step. The authors show that initializing the gain parameter in the recurrent batch normalization layer to 0.1 makes significant difference in the final performance of the model. Our work is also related to weight normalization [Salimans and Kingma, 2016]. In weight normalization, <strong>instead of the variance, the L2 norm of the incoming weights is used to normalize the summed inputs to a neuron</strong>. Applying either weight normalization or batch normalization using expected statistics is equivalent to have a different parameterization of the original feed-forward neural network. Re-parameterization in the ReLU network was studied in the Pathnormalized SGD [Neyshabur et al., 2015]. Our proposed layer normalization method, however, is <strong>not a re-parameterization of the original neural network. The layer normalized model, thus, has different invariance properties than the other methods</strong>, that we will study in the following section</p>\n</blockquote>\n"

    "title": "Gumbel-Softmax trick vs Softmax with temperature",
    "body": "<p>From what I understand, the <em>Gumbel-Softmax</em> trick is a technique that enables us to sample discrete random variables, in a way that is differentiable (and therefore suited for end-to-end deep learning).</p>\n\n<p>Many papers and articles describe it as a way of selecting instances in the input (i.e. 'pointers') without using the non-differentiable argmax-function. The thing that confuses me is that this effect can be achieved without randomness by just using <em>Softmax with temperature</em>:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Softmax with temperature</strong>\n<span class=\"math-container\">$$y_𝑖=\\frac{exp(\\frac{𝑧_𝑖}{\\tau})}{\\sum_{𝑗}exp(\\frac{𝑧_𝑗}{\\tau})}$$</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Gumbel-Softmax</strong>\n<span class=\"math-container\">$$y_𝑖=\\frac{exp(\\frac{log(\\pi_𝑖)+g_i}{\\tau})}{\\sum_{𝑗}exp(\\frac{log(\\pi_j)+g_j}{\\tau})}$$</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>My question</strong> </p>\n\n<p><em>From a practical and theoretical perspective, when is it beneficial to incorporate Gumbel noise into a neural network, as opposed to just using Softmax with temperature?</em></p>\n\n<p>A couple of observations:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>When the temperature is low, both Softmax with temperature and the Gumbel-Softmax functions will approximate a one-hot vector. However, before convergence, the Gumbel-Softmax may more suddenly 'change' its decision because of the noise.</li>\n<li>When the temperature is higher, the Gumbel noise will get a larger significance and the distribution will become more uniform. Why is this desired?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>My best guess is that the introduction of the Gumbel noise enforces stronger exploration before convergence, but I can't recall reading any papers that use this as a motivation to bring in the extra randomness.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone have any experience or insights on this? Maybe I've completely missed the key point of Gumbel-Softmax :)</p>\n"

On the other hand, both these measures can be used in doing the same thing - assessing the quality of a decision tree split.</p>\n"

    "body": "<p>So, I'm just starting to learn how a neural network can operate to recognize patterns and categorize inputs, and I've seen how an artificial neural network can parse image data and categorize the images (<a href=\"http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/demo/mnist.html\">demo with convnetjs</a>), and the key there is to downsample the image and each pixel stimulates one input neuron into the network.</p>\n\n<p>However, I'm trying to wrap my head around if this is possible to be done with string inputs? The use-case I've got is a \"recommendation engine\" for movies a user has watched. Movies have lots of string data (title, plot, tags), and I could imagine \"downsampling\" the text down to a few key words that describe that movie, but even if I parse out the top five words that describe this movie, I think I'd need input neurons for every english word in order to compare a set of movies? I could limit the input neurons just to the words used in the set, but then could it grow/learn by adding new movies (user watches a new movie, with new words)? Most of the libraries I've seen don't allow adding new neurons after the system has been trained?</p>\n\n<p>Is there a standard way to map string/word/character data to inputs into a neural network? Or is a neural network really not the right tool for the job of parsing string data like this (what's a better tool for pattern-matching in string data)?</p>\n"

    "body": "<p>Note that I am doing everything in R. </p>\n\n<p>The problem goes as follow: </p>\n\n<p>Basically, I have a list of resumes (CVs). Some candidates will have work experience before and some don't. The goal here is to: based on the text on their CVs, I want to classify them into different job sectors. I am particular in those cases, in which the candidates do not have any experience / is a student, and I want to make a prediction to classify which job sectors this candidate will most likely belongs to after graduation . </p>\n\n<p>Question 1: I know machine learning algorithms. However, I have never done NLP before. I came across Latent Dirichlet allocation on the internet. However, I am not sure if this is the best approach to tackle my problem. </p>\n\n<p>My original idea:  <em>make this a supervised learning problem</em>. \nSuppose we already have large amount of labelled data, meaning that we have correctly labelled the job sectors for a list of candidates. We train the model up using ML algorithms (i.e. nearest neighbor... )and feed in those <em>unlabelled data</em>, which are candidates that have no work experience / are students, and try to predict which job sector they will belong to. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong>\nQuestion 2: Would it be a good idea to create an text file by extracting everything in a resume and print these data out in the text file, so that each resume is associated with a text file,which contains unstructured strings, and then we applied text mining techniques to the text files and make the data become structured or even to create a  frequency matrix of terms used out of the text files ? For example, the text file may look something like this:</p>\n\n<p><code>I deployed ML algorithm in this project and... Skills: Java, Python, c++ ...</code></p>\n\n<p>This is what I meant by 'unstructured', i.e. collapsing everything into a single line string.</p>\n\n<p>Is this approach wrong ? Please correct me if you think my approach is wrong. </p>\n\n<p>Question 3: The tricky part is: how to <strong>identify and extract the keywords</strong> ? Using the <code>tm</code> package in R ? what algorithm is the <code>tm</code>   package based on ?  Should I use NLP algorithms ? If yes, what algorithms should I look at ? Please point me to some good resources to look at as well. </p>\n\n<p>Any ideas would be great.</p>\n"

    "title": "Neural Network for Multiple Output Regression",
    "body": "<p>I have a dataset containing 34 input columns and 8 output columns.</p>\n\n<p>One way to solve the problem is to take the 34 inputs and build individual regression model for each output column.</p>\n\n<p>I am wondering if this problem can be solved using just one model particularly using Neural Network.</p>\n\n<p>I have used Multilayer Perceptron but that needs multiple models just like linear regression. Can Sequence to Sequence be a viable option? </p>\n\n<p>I am using TensorFlow. I have code but I think it is more important to understand what I am missing out in terms of the multilayer perceptron theory. </p>\n\n<p>I understand that in MLP if you have one output node it will provide one output. If you have 10 output nodes then it is a multi class problem. You pick the class with the highest probability out of the 10 outputs. But in my case it is certain there will be 8 outputs for same input. </p>\n\n<p>Lets say, for a set of inputs you will get the 3D coordinate of something (X,Y,Z). Like, Inputs = {1,10,5,7} Output = {1,2,1}. So for the same input {1,10,5,7} I need to make models for X value Y value and Z. One solution is to have 3 different models using MLP. But I would like to see if I can have one model. So I thought about using seq2seq. Because the encoder takes a series of input and the decoder provides series of output. But it seems seq2seq in tensorflow cannot handle float values. I can be wrong about this though.</p>\n"

Some of these embedding (manifold learning) methods are described <a href=\"http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/manifold.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/H3FBv.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/H3FBv.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p><strong>But is this \"pretty picture\" actually meaningful? What possible insights can someone grab by trying to visualize this embedded space?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I ask because the projection down to this embedded space is usually meaningless. For example, if you project your data down to principal components generated by PCA, those principal components (eiganvectors) don't correspond to features in the dataset; they're their own feature space. </p>\n\n<p>Similarly, t-SNE projects your data down to a space, where items are near each other if they minimize some KL divergence. This isn't the original feature space anymore. (Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't even think there is a large effort by the ML community to use t-SNE to aid classification; that's a different problem than data visualization though.)</p>\n\n<p>I'm just very largely confused why people make such a big deal about some of these visualizations. </p>\n"

The categorical data may be represented as one-hot code A, while the continuous data is just a vector B in N-dimension space. It seems that simply using concat(A, B) is not a good choice because A, B are totally different kinds of data. For example, unlike B, there is no numerical order in A. So my question is how to combine such two kinds of data or is there any conventional method to handle them.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, I propose a naive structure as presented in the picture</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/QgQFq.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/QgQFq.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>As you see, the first few layers are used to change(or map) data A to some middle output in continuous space and it is then being concated with data B which forms a new input feature in continuous space for later layers. I wonder whether it is reasonable or it is just a \"trial and error\" game. Thank you.</p>\n"

    "title": "What is the exact definition of VC dimension?",
    "body": "<p>I'm studying machine learning from Andrew Ng Stanford lectures and just came across the theory of VC dimensions. According to the lectures and what I understood, the definition of VC dimension can be given as, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If you can find a set of $n$ points, so that it can be shattered by the classifier (i.e. classify all possible $2^n$ labeling correctly) and you cannot find any set of $n+1$ points that can be shattered (i.e. for any set of $n+1$ points there is at least one labeling order so that the classifier can not separate all points correctly), then the VC dimension is $n$. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Also Professor took an example and explained this nicely. Which is: </p>\n\n<p>Let,</p>\n\n<p>$H=\\{{set\\ of\\ linear\\ classifiers\\ in\\ 2\\ Dimensions \\}}$</p>\n\n<p>Then any 3 points can be classified by $H$ correctly with separating hyper plane as shown in the following figure. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/iPJBN.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/iPJBN.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>And that's why the VC dimension of $H$ is 3. Because for any 4 points in 2D plane, a linear classifier can not shatter all the combinations of the points. For example, </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/U7xVB.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/U7xVB.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a> </p>\n\n<p>For this set of points, <strong>there is no separating hyper plane can be drawn to classify this set. So the VC dimension is 3.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I get the idea till here. But what if we've following type of pattern?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/4nLut.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/4nLut.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Or the pattern where a three points coincides on each other, Here also we can not draw separating hyper plane between 3 points. But still this pattern is not considered in the definition of the VC dimension. Why? The same point is also discussed the lectures I'm watching <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kWZoyNRxTY&amp;index=10&amp;list=PLA89DCFA6ADACE599\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Here at 16:24</a> but professor does not mention the exact reason behind this.</p>\n\n<p>Any intuitive example of explanation will be appreciated. Thanks</p>\n"

    "body": "<p>I have a doubt regarding the cross validation approach and train-validation-test approach.</p>\n\n<p>I was told that I can split a dataset into 3 parts: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Train: we train the model.</li>\n<li>Validation: we validate and adjust model parameters.</li>\n<li>Test: never seen before data. We get an unbiased final estimate.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So far, we have split into three subsets.  Until here everything is okay. Attached is a picture:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/osBuF.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/osBuF.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Then I came across the K-fold cross validation approach and what I don’t understand is how I can relate the <strong>Test</strong> subset from the above approach. Meaning, in 5-fold cross validation we split the data into 5 and in each iteration the non-validation subset is used as the train subset and the validation is used as test set. But, in terms of the above mentioned example, where is the validation part in k-fold cross validation? We either have validation or test subset. </p>\n\n<p>When I refer myself to train/validation/test, that “test” is the scoring: </p>\n\n<p>Model development is generally a two-stage process. The first stage is training and validation, during which you apply algorithms to data for which you know the outcomes to uncover patterns between its features and the target variable. The second stage is scoring, in which you apply the trained model to a new dataset. Then, it returns outcomes in the form of probability scores for classification problems and estimated averages for regression problems. Finally, you deploy the trained model into a production application or use the insights it uncovers to improve business processes.</p>\n\n<p>As an example, I found the Sci-Kit learn cross validation version as you can see in the following picture:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/8mtoy.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/8mtoy.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>When doing the splitting, you can see that the algorithm that they give you, only takes care of the training part of the original dataset. So, in the end, we are not able to perform the <strong>Final evaluation</strong> process as you can see in the attached picture. </p>\n\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">scikitpage</a></p>\n"

    "title": "How to deal with time series which change in seasonality or other patterns?",
    "body": "<h3>Background</h3>\n<p>I'm working on a time series data set of energy meter readings. The length of the series varies by meter - for some I have several years, others only a few months, etc. Many display significant seasonality, and often multiple layers - within the day, week, or year.</p>\n<p>One of the things I've been working on is clustering of these time series. My work is academic for the moment, and while I'm doing other analysis of the data as well, I have a specific goal to carry out some clustering.</p>\n<p>I did some initial work where I calculated various features (percentage used on weekends vs. weekday, percentage used in different time blocks, etc.). I then moved on to looking at using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to obtain the distance between different series, and clustering based on the difference values, and I've found several papers related to this.</p>\n<h3>Question</h3>\n<p>Will the seasonality in a specific series changing cause my clustering to be incorrect? And if so, how do I deal with it?</p>\n<p>My concern is that the distances obtained by DTW could be misleading in the cases where the pattern in a time series has changed. This could lead to incorrect clustering.</p>\n<p>In case the above is unclear, consider these examples:</p>\n<h3>Example 1</h3>\n<p>A meter has low readings from midnight until 8AM, the readings then increase sharply for the next hour and stay high from 9AM until 5PM, then decrease sharply over the next hour and then stay low from 6PM until midnight. The meter continues this pattern consistently every day for several months, but then changes to a pattern where readings simply stay at a consistent level throughout the day.</p>\n<h3>Example 2</h3>\n<p>A meter shows approximately the same amount of energy being consumed each month. After several years, it changes to a pattern where energy usage is higher during the summer months before returning to the usual amount.</p>\n<h3>Possible Directions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>I've wondered whether I can continue to compare whole time series, but split them and consider them as a separate series if the pattern changes considerably. However, to do this I'd need to be able to detect such changes. Also, I just don't know if this is a suitable way or working with the data.</li>\n<li>I've also considered splitting the data and considering it as many separate time series. For instance, I could consider every day/meter combination as a separate series. However, I'd then need to do similarly if I wanted to consider the weekly/monthly/yearly patterns. I <em>think</em> this would work, but it's potentially quite onerous and I'd hate to go down this path if there's a better way that I'm missing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Further Notes</h3>\n<p>These are things that have come up in comments, or things I've thought of due to comments, which might be relevant. I'm putting them here so people don't have to read through everything to get relevant information.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I'm working in Python, but have rpy for those places where R is more suitable. I'm not necessarily looking for a Python answer though - if someone has a practical answer of what should be done I'm happy to figure out implementation details myself.</li>\n<li>I have a lot of working &quot;rough draft&quot; code - I've done some DTW runs, I've done a couple of different types of clustering, etc. I think I largely understand the direction I'm taking, and what I'm really looking for is related to how I process my data before finding distances, running clustering, etc. Given this, I suspect the answer would be the same whether the distances between series are calculated via DTW or a simpler Euclidean Distance (ED).</li>\n<li>I have found these papers especially informative on time series and DTW and they may be helpful if some background is needed to the topic area: <a href=\"http://www.cs.ucr.edu/%7Eeamonn/selected_publications.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/selected_publications.htm</a></li>\n</ul>\n"

    "body": "<p><strong>Word2vec</strong>:\nWord2vec provides a vector for each token/word and those vectors encode the meaning of the word. Although those vectors are not human interpretable, the meaning of the vectors are understandable/interpretable by comparing with other vectors (for example, the vector of <code>dog</code> will be most similar to the vector of <code>cat</code>), and various interesting equations (for example <code>king-men+women=queen</code>, which proves how well those vectors hold the semantic of words).</p>\n\n<p><strong>The problem</strong> with word2vec is that each word has only one vector but in the real world each word has different meaning depending on the context and sometimes the meaning can be totally different (for example, <code>bank as a financial institute</code> vs <code>bank of the river</code>).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bert:</strong>\nOne important difference between Bert/ELMO (dynamic word embedding) and Word2vec is that these models consider the context and for each token, there is a vector.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Now the question is</strong>, do vectors from Bert hold the behaviors of word2Vec and solve the meaning disambiguation problem (as this is a contextual word embedding)? </p>\n\n<p><strong>Experiments</strong>\nTo get the vectors from google's pre-trained model, I used <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/bert-embedding/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">bert-embedding-1.0.1</a> library. \nI first tried to see whether it hold the <strong>similarity property</strong>. To test, I took the first paragraphs from wikipedia page of Dog, Cat, and Bank (financial institute). The similar word for <code>dog</code> is: \n    ('dog',1.0)\n    ('wolf', 0.7254540324211121)\n    ('domestic', 0.6261438727378845)\n    ('cat', 0.6036421656608582)\n    ('canis', 0.5722522139549255)\n    ('mammal', 0.5652133226394653)\nHere, the first element is token and second is the similarity.</p>\n\n<p>Now for <strong>disambiguation test</strong>: \nAlong with Dog, Cat and Bank (financtial institute), I added a paragraph of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_(geography)\" rel=\"noreferrer\">River bank</a> from wikipedia. This is to check that bert can differentiate between two different types of <code>Bank</code>. Here the hope is, the vector of token bank (of river) will be close to vector of <code>river</code> or <code>water</code> but far away from <code>bank(financial institute)</code>, <code>credit</code>, <code>financial</code> etc. Here is the result: \nThe second element is the sentence to show the context. </p>\n\n<pre><code>('bank', 'in geography , the word bank generally refers to the land alongside a body of water . different structures are referred to as', 1.0)\n('bank', 'a bank is a financial institution that accepts deposits from the public and creates credit .', 0.7796692848205566)\n('bank', 'in limnology , a stream bank or river bank is the terrain alongside the bed of a river , creek , or', 0.7275459170341492)\n('bank', 'in limnology , a stream bank or river bank is the terrain alongside the bed of a river , creek , or', 0.7121304273605347)\n('bank', 'the bank consists of the sides of the channel , between which the flow is confined .', 0.6965076327323914)\n('banks', 'markets to their importance in the financial stability of a country , banks are highly regulated in most countries .', 0.6590269804000854)\n('banking', 'most nations have institutionalized a system known as fractional reserve banking under which banks hold liquid assets equal to only a', 0.6490173935890198)\n('banks', 'most nations have institutionalized a system known as fractional reserve banking under which banks hold liquid assets equal to only a', 0.6224181652069092)\n('financial', 'a bank is a financial institution that accepts deposits from the public and creates credit .', 0.614281952381134)\n('banks', 'stream banks are of particular interest in fluvial geography , which studies the processes associated with rivers and streams and the deposits', 0.6096583604812622)\n('structures', 'in geography , the word bank generally refers to the land alongside a body of water . different structures are referred to as', 0.5771245360374451)\n('financial', 'markets to their importance in the financial stability of a country , banks are highly regulated in most countries .', 0.5701562166213989)\n('reserve', 'most nations have institutionalized a system known as fractional reserve banking under which banks hold liquid assets equal to only a', 0.5462549328804016)\n('institution', 'a bank is a financial institution that accepts deposits from the public and creates credit .', 0.537483811378479)\n('land', 'in geography , the word bank generally refers to the land alongside a body of water . different structures are referred to as', 0.5331911444664001)\n('of', 'in geography , the word bank generally refers to the land alongside a body of water . different structures are referred to as', 0.527492105960846)\n('water', 'in geography , the word bank generally refers to the land alongside a body of water . different structures are referred to as', 0.5234918594360352)\n('banks', 'bankfull discharge is a discharge great enough to fill the channel and overtop the banks .', 0.5213838815689087)\n('lending', 'lending activities can be performed either directly or indirectly through due capital .', 0.5207482576370239)\n('deposits', 'a bank is a financial institution that accepts deposits from the public and creates credit .', 0.5131596922874451)\n('stream', 'in limnology , a stream bank or river bank is the terrain alongside the bed of a river , creek , or', 0.5108630061149597)\n('bankfull', 'bankfull discharge is a discharge great enough to fill the channel and overtop the banks .', 0.5102289915084839)\n('river', 'in limnology , a stream bank or river bank is the terrain alongside the bed of a river , creek , or', 0.5099104046821594)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here, the result of the most similar vectors of bank (as a river bank, the token is taken from the context of the first row and that is why the similarity score is 1.0. So, the second one is the closest vector). From the result, it can be seen that the first most close token's meaning and context is very different. Even the token <code>river</code>, <code>water and</code>stream` has lower similarity. </p>\n\n<p>So, it seems that the vectors do not really disambiguate the meaning. \nWhy is that?\nIsn't the contextual token vector supposed to disambiguate the meaning of a word?</p>\n"

My current approach is to use tf-idf weighted term frequencies and learn a simple linear classifier (logistic regression). This works reasonably well (around 90% macro F-1 on test set, nearly 100% on training set). A big problem are unseen words/n-grams. </p>\n\n<p>I am trying to improve the classifier by adding other features, e.g. a fixed sized vector computed using distributional similarities (as computed by word2vec) or other categorical features of the examples. My idea was to just add the features to the sparse input features from the bag of words. However, this results in worse performance on the test and training set. The additional features by themselves give about 80% F-1 on the test set, so they aren't garbage. Scaling the features didn't help as well. My current thinking is that these kind of features don't mix well with the (sparse) bag of words features.</p>\n\n<p>So the question is: assuming the additional features provide additional information, what is the best way to incorporate them? Could training separate classifiers and combining them in some kind of ensemble work (this would probably have the drawback that no interaction between the features of the different classifiers could be captured)? Are there other more complex models I should consider?</p>\n"

It seems that this method does not require any variable scaling since it is based on trees and this one can capture complex non-linearity pattern, interactions. And it can handle both numerical and categorical variables and it also seems that redundant variables does not affect this method too much. </p>\n\n<p>Usually, in predictive modeling, you may do some selection among all the features you have and you may also create some new features from the set of features you have. So select a subset of features means you think there are some redundancy in your set of features; create some new features from the current feature set means you do some functional transformations on your current features. Then, both of these two points should be covered in XGBoost. Then, does it mean that to use XGBoost, you only need to choose those tunning parameters wisely? What is the value of doing feature engineering using XGBoost?</p>\n"

    "body": "<p>I am an MSc student at the University of Edinburgh, specialized in machine learning and natural language processing. I had some practical courses focused on data mining, and others dealing with machine learning, bayesian statistics and graphical models. My background is a BSc in Computer Science.</p>\n\n<p>I did some software engineering and I learnt the basic concepts, such as design patterns, but I have never been involved in a large software development project. However, I had a data mining project in my MSc. My question is, if I want to go for a career as Data Scientist, should I apply for a graduate data scientist position first, or should I get a position as graduate software engineer first, maybe something related to data science, such as big data infrastructure or machine learning software development?</p>\n\n<p>My concern is that I might need good software engineering skills for data science, and I am not sure if these can be obtained by working as a graduate data scientist directly.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, at the moment I like Data Mining, but what if I want to change my career to software engineering in the future? It might be difficult if I specialised so much in data science.</p>\n\n<p>I have not been employed yet, so my knowledge is still limited. Any clarification or advice are welcome, as I am about to finish my MSc and I want to start applying for graduate positions in early October.</p>\n"

    "title": "Sliding window leads to overfitting in LSTM?",
    "body": "<p>Will I overfit my LSTM if I train it via the sliding-window approach? Why do people not seem to use it for LSTMs?</p>\n<p>For a simplified example, assume that we have to predict the sequence of characters:</p>\n<pre><code>A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z\n</code></pre>\n<p>Is it bad (or better?) if I keep training my LSTM with the following minibatches:</p>\n<pre><code>A B C D E F G H I J K L M N, backprop, erase the cell\n\nB C D E F G H I J K L M N O, backprop, erase the cell\n\n .... and so on, shifting by 1 every time?\n</code></pre>\n<p>Previously, I always trained it as:</p>\n<pre><code>A B C D E F G H I J K L M N,  backprop, erase the cell\n\nO P Q R S T U V W X Y Z,  backprop, erase the cell\n</code></pre>\n<hr />\n<p>Instead of shifting by one, would it be better to slide the window by 2 entries instead, etc? What would that mean (in terms of precision/overfitting)?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Also, if I were to do the sliding-window approach in a Feed-forward network, would it result in overfitting? I would assume yes, because the network is exposed to the same information regions for a very long time. For example, it is exposed to <code>E F G H I J K</code> for a long time.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>\n<p>Please remember that cell state is erased between training batches, so the LSTM will have a &quot;hammer to head&quot; at these times. <strong>It's unable to remember</strong> what was before OPQRSTUVWXYZ. This means that the LSTM is unable to ever learn that &quot;O&quot; follows the &quot;M&quot;.</p>\n<p>So, I thought (thus my entire question), why not to give it intermediate (overlapping) batch in between...and in that case why not use multiple overlapping minibatches - to me this would provide a smoother training? Ultimately, that would mean a sliding window for an LSTM.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Some useful info I've found after answer was accepted:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wildml.com/2016/01/attention-and-memory-in-deep-learning-and-nlp/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">from here</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The first word of the English translation is probably highly correlated with the first word of the source sentence. But that means decoder has to consider information from 50 steps ago, and that information needs to be somehow encoded in the vector. Recurrent Neural Networks are known to have problems dealing with such long-range dependencies. In theory, architectures like LSTMs should be able to deal with this, but in practice long-range dependencies are still problematic.</p>\n<p>For example, researchers have found that reversing the source sequence\n(feeding it backwards into the encoder) produces significantly better\nresults because it shortens the path from the decoder to the relevant\nparts of the encoder. <strong>Similarly, feeding an input sequence twice also\nseems to help a network to better memorize things.</strong> For example, if one training example is &quot;John went home&quot;, you would give &quot;John went home John went home&quot; to the network as one input.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Edit after accepting the answer:</strong></p>\n<p>Several months after, I am more inclined to use the sliding window approach, as it uses the data better. But in that case you probably don't want to train BCDEFGHIJKLMNO right after ABCDEFGHIJKLMN.  Instead, shuffle your examples, to gradually and uniformly &quot;brush-in&quot; <strong>all</strong> of the information into your LSTM.  Give it HIJKLMNOPQRSTU after ABCDEFGHIJKLMNO etc.  That's directly related to Catastrophic Forgetting. As always, monitor the Validation and Test set closely, and stop as soon as you see their errors steadily increasing</p>\n<p>Also, the &quot;hammer to head&quot; issue can be improved, by using Synthetic Gradients. See its benefit here: (linked answer discusses its benefit of long sequences) <a href=\"https://datascience.stackexchange.com/a/32425/43077\">https://datascience.stackexchange.com/a/32425/43077</a></p>\n"

    "body": "<p>I'm training a convolutional neural network to classify images on fog conditions (3 classes). However, for each of about 150.000 images I also have four meteorological variables available that might help in predicting the classes of the images. I was wondering how I could add the meteorological variables (e.g. temperature, wind speed) to the existing CNN structure so that it can help in the classification.</p>\n\n<p>One way I can already think of is creating another (small) feedforward neural net alongside the CNN and then concatenating the outputs of the CNN layers and the hidden layers of the non-image neural net to each other at the dense layer.</p>\n\n<p>The second way I could think of is just contacting these features to the dense layer. However, in this case, the non-image variables will (I think) only be able to make linear predictions. </p>\n\n<p>Are there any other (better) ways that the non-image features could be included in the model? And what would be the advisable method considering the amount of data I have? </p>\n\n<p>Another question I have is whether or not I should unfreeze the convolutional layers while training with these non-image features? These layers of a Resnet-18 (which were initialized as pre-trained on ImageNet) have already been fine-tuned using the images. My guess is that I should keep them frozen and only unfreeze the dense layer since it is only here that the non-image features come into 'contact' with the image features (not earlier in the CNN). If I'm wrong on this, please say so!</p>\n"

    "body": "<p>I am trying to find a formula, method, or model to use to analyze the likelihood that a specific event influenced some longitudinal data. I am having difficultly figuring out what to search for on Google.</p>\n\n<p>Here is an example scenario:</p>\n\n<p>Image you own a business that has an average of 100 walk-in customers every day. One day, you decide you want to increase the number of walk-in customers arriving at your store each day, so you pull a crazy stunt outside your store to get attention. Over the next week, you see on average 125 customers a day.</p>\n\n<p>Over the next few months, you again decide that you want to get some more business, and perhaps sustain it a bit longer, so you try some other random things to get more customers in your store. Unfortunately, you are not the best marketer, and some of your tactics have little or no effect, and others even have a negative impact.</p>\n\n<p>What methodology could I use to determine the probability that any one individual event positively or negatively impacted the number of walk-in customers? I am fully aware that correlation does not necessarily equal causation, but what methods could I use to determine the likely increase or decrease in your business's daily walk in client's following a specific event?</p>\n\n<p>I am not interested in analyzing whether or not there is a correlation between your attempts to increase the number of walk-in customers, but rather whether or not any one single event, independent of all others, was impactful.</p>\n\n<p>I realize that this example is rather contrived and simplistic, so I will also give you a brief description of the actual data that I am using:</p>\n\n<p>I am attempting to determine the impact that a particular marketing agency has on their client's website when they publish new content, perform social media campaigns, etc. For any one specific agency, they may have anywhere from 1 to 500 clients. Each client has websites ranging in size from 5 pages to well over 1 million. Over the course of the past 5 year, each agency has annotated all of their work for each client, including the type of work that was done, the number of webpages on a website that were influenced, the number of hours spent, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Using the above data, which I have assembled into a data warehouse (placed into a bunch of star/snowflake schemas), I need to determine how likely it was that any one piece of work (any one event in time) had an impact on the traffic hitting any/all pages influenced by a specific piece of work. I have created models for 40 different types of content that are found on a website that describes the typical traffic pattern a page with said content type might experience from launch date until present. Normalized relative to the appropriate model, I need to determine the highest and lowest number of increased or decreased visitors a specific page received as the result of a specific piece of work.</p>\n\n<p>While I have experience with basic data analysis (linear and multiple regression, correlation, etc), I am at a loss for how to approach solving this problem. Whereas in the past I have typically analyzed data with multiple measurements for a given axis (for example temperature vs thirst vs animal and determined the impact on thirst that increased temperate has across animals), I feel that above, I am attempting to analyze the impact of a single event at some point in time for a non-linear, but predictable (or at least model-able), longitudinal dataset. I am stumped :(</p>\n\n<p>Any help, tips, pointers, recommendations, or directions would be extremely helpful and I would be eternally grateful!</p>\n"

Given the size of my dataset and some initial tests I performed, my assumption is that the method I will use will need to be either parallel or distributed. So I'm considering two classes of possible solutions: one that is either available (or implementable in a reasonably easy way) on a single multicore machine, the other on a Spark cluster, i.e. as a MapReduce program. Here are three broad ideas that I considered:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Assuming a cosine similarity metric, perform the full multiplication of the normalized matrix by its transpose (implemented as a sum of outer products)</li>\n<li>Using locality-sensitive hashing (LSH)</li>\n<li>Reducing first the dimensionality of the problem with a PCA</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I'd appreciate any thoughts or advices about possible other ways in which I could tackle this problem.</p>\n"

I remember the time before the popularity of <code>Relu</code> that <code>tanh</code> was the most popular amongst machine learning experts rather than <code>sigmoid</code>. The reason was that the expected value of the <code>tanh</code> was equal to zero and and it helped learning in deeper layers to be more rapid in a neural net. <code>Relu</code> does not have this characteristic, but why it is working so good if we put its derivative advantage aside. Moreover, I guess the derivative also may be affected. Because the activations (output of <code>Relu</code>) are involved for calculating the update rules.</p>\n"

The answer provided points to some literature, but the formal proof is nowhere to be included. Looking at Sutton,Barto- Reinforcement Learning, they claim that convergence of the REINFORCE Monte Carlo algorithm is guaranteed under stochastic approximation step size requirements, but they do not seem to reference any sources that go into more detail.</p>\n<p>I am curious whether or not anybody actually has a formal proof ready for me to read. I found a paper, which goes into detail for proving convergence of a general online stochastic gradient descent algorithm, see, <a href=\"https://leon.bottou.org/publications/pdf/online-1998.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">section 2.3</a>.</p>\n<p>However, I am not sure if the proof provided in the paper is applicable to the algorithm described in Sutton's book. In the mentioned algorithm, one obtains samples which, assuming that the policy did not change, is in expectation at least proportional to the gradient. However, the analytic expression of the gradient</p>\n<p><span class=\"math-container\">$$\\nabla J(\\theta) \\propto \\sum_s \\mu(s)\\sum_a q_{\\pi}(s,a)\\nabla \\pi(a|s,\\theta)$$</span></p>\n<p>depends on the on policy state distribution <span class=\"math-container\">$\\mu(s)$</span> which changes when we update <span class=\"math-container\">$\\theta$</span>. Therefore, when updating during the algorithm, the distribution changes.</p>\n<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. Bottou's paper, which I linked above states that the event is drawn from a fixed probability distribution, which is not the case here.</p>\n<p>EDIT:</p>\n<p>So after reading some more papers, I found <a href=\"https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/3462/P-2404-38121470.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this</a>, which is a paper of Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis. They argue that under certain assumptions convergence to a stationary point is guaranteed, where one has an update rule of the form</p>\n<p><span class=\"math-container\">$$x_{t+1} = x_t +\\gamma_t (s_t + w_t)$$</span>\nand <span class=\"math-container\">$w_t$</span> is some error with\n<span class=\"math-container\">$$\\mathbb{E}[w_t  | \\mathcal{F}_t] = 0$$</span>\nfor ascending <span class=\"math-container\">$\\sigma$</span>-fields <span class=\"math-container\">$\\mathcal{F}_t$</span>, which can be thought of conditioning on the trajectory <span class=\"math-container\">$x_0,s_0\\dots,x_{t-1},s_{t-1},w_{t-1},x_t,s_t$</span>.\nI believe that this might be a solution since we need an expected gradient update given the past parameter <span class=\"math-container\">$x_t$</span>, which determines the sampling distribution which is exactly what the policy gradient theorem guarantees.\nI'd be happy if someone could verify this.</p>\n"

    "body": "<p>I have built an ML model with the goal of making predictions for targets of the following week. In general, new data will come in and be processed at the end of each week and be in the <em>same</em> data structure as before. In other words, the same number of features, same classes for classification, etc.</p>\n<p>Instead of re-training the model from scratch for each week's predictions, I am considering applying an incremental learning approach so that past learning is not entirely discarded and the model would (presumably) increase in performance over time. I'm working with <code>sklearn</code>  on Python 3. There were only a handful of posts on StackOverflow regarding this, but many of the answers seem inconsistent (possibly due to updates with sklearn's API?).</p>\n<p>The documentation <a href=\"https://scikit-learn.org/0.15/modules/scaling_strategies.html#incremental-learning\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://scikit-learn.org/stable/glossary.html#term-partial-fit\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> suggests that incremental/online learning is possible with certain ML implementations - implying that the new datasets could be thought of as &quot;mini-batches&quot; and incrementally trained by saving/loading the model and calling <code>.partial_fit()</code> with the same model parameters.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Although all algorithms cannot learn incrementally (i.e. without seeing all the instances at once), all estimators implementing the partial_fit API are candidates. <a href=\"https://scikit-learn.org/0.15/modules/scaling_strategies.html#incremental-learning\" rel=\"noreferrer\">1</a></p>\n<p>Unlike fit, repeatedly calling partial_fit does not clear the model, but updates it with respect to the data provided. The portion of data provided to partial_fit may be called a mini-batch. Each mini-batch must be of consistent shape, etc. In iterative estimators, partial_fit often only performs a single iteration. <a href=\"https://scikit-learn.org/stable/glossary.html#term-partial-fit\" rel=\"noreferrer\">2</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, the documentation <a href=\"https://scikit-learn.org/stable/glossary.html#term-warm-start\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> is throwing me off.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>partial_fit also retains the model between calls, but differs: with warm_start the parameters change and the data is (more-or-less) constant across calls to fit; with partial_fit, the mini-batch of data changes and model parameters stay fixed. <a href=\"https://scikit-learn.org/stable/glossary.html#term-warm-start\" rel=\"noreferrer\">3</a></p>\n<p>There are cases where you want to use warm_start to fit on different, but closely related data. <a href=\"https://scikit-learn.org/stable/glossary.html#term-warm-start\" rel=\"noreferrer\">3</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For the problem I am tackling, <em>ideally</em> model parameters should be adjusted based on cross-validation and new datasets should  be weighted more heavily than old ones due to concept drift. However  ignoring this for now,</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In (3), what exactly does &quot;(more-or-less) constant...different but closely related data&quot; mean? Since the data structure of new datasets are the same, should i be calling <code>estimator(warm_start=True).fit(#new df)</code> or <code>estimator.partial_fit(#new df)</code>?</li>\n<li>For iterative estimators such as <code>sklearn.linear_model.SGDClassifier</code>, only one epoch is run when using <code>.partial_fit()</code>. If I want <span class=\"math-container\">$k$</span> epochs, would calling it on the same dataset repeatedly be the same as calling <code>.fit()</code> with <span class=\"math-container\">$k$</span> epochs to begin with?</li>\n<li>Do dedicated libraries such as <code>creme</code> offer any advantage for incremental learniing?</li>\n</ol>\n"

Furthermore I don't want something that looks like a recipe book from the very beginning.

    "body": "<h2>What I'm trying to do</h2>\n\n<p>What I am trying to do is predicting the next data-point <span class=\"math-container\">$x_t$</span> for each point in the timeseries <span class=\"math-container\">$[x_0, x_1, x_2,...,x_T]$</span> in the context of a date-stream in real-time, in theory the series is infinity. If a new value <span class=\"math-container\">$x$</span> is coming, i feed it into the network and predict the next one.\nSo <em>seq-to-seq</em> model with the <em>return_sequenze</em> parameter set to <span class=\"math-container\">$True$</span> does not work, because in practical application, at time <span class=\"math-container\">$t$</span> we do not have the data-points <span class=\"math-container\">$x_i$</span> for <span class=\"math-container\">$i&gt;t$</span>. For a multistep-prediction I use a manual loop back, where I feed the predicted value <span class=\"math-container\">$\\hat{x}$</span> as the new input.(Knowing what comes next - compensation if nothing comes)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Z3eHn.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Z3eHn.png\" alt=\"unrolled LSTM\"></a></p>\n\n<h2>My understanding of LSTM</h2>\n\n<p>Maybe there is something basic that I have misunderstood\n:</p>\n\n<h2>Timelags</h2>\n\n<p>If we take a stepsize of 3 (in a <em>one-to-many</em> network), we are ending up with <em>input/output</em> samples <span class=\"math-container\">$([x_0,x_1,x_2], x_3),([x_1,x_2,x_3], x_4), ..., ([x_{T-3},x_{T-2},x_{T-1}], x_T)$</span> (Using Rolling-windows), or <span class=\"math-container\">$([x_0,x_1,x_2], x_3),([x_3,x_4,x_5], x_6), ..., ([x_{T-3},x_{T-2},x_{T-1}], x_T)$</span> (Not using Rolling-windows). Using a batchsize of 1, the networkinput is <span class=\"math-container\">$(1,3,n\\_features)$</span>, where <span class=\"math-container\">$n\\_features$</span> is the dimension of <span class=\"math-container\">$X_i$</span> (<span class=\"math-container\">$1$</span> for an univariat timeseries, <span class=\"math-container\">$&gt;1$</span> for multivariate timeseries).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Uh6hb.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Uh6hb.png\" alt=\"LSTM (1,3,x) sample\"></a></p>\n\n<h2>Batches and timelags</h2>\n\n<p>So far so good. But, considering the batchsize and that within the batch the states of the Cells are not reset, the initial state of the second sample is the state at the end of the first sample. So with a batchsize of <span class=\"math-container\">$2$</span> the network gets the input as shown in the picture below (Inputshape would be <span class=\"math-container\">$(2, 3, n\\_features)$</span>).The number in the superscript indicates the sample. Doing so, we are messing up the timeseries, because, as you can see, the series now is <span class=\"math-container\">$[x_0, x_1, x_2, x_1, x_2, x_3]$</span>. (The same problem occurs between to batches, if the network is set to be stateful). \nIf the samples are not generated by rolling-windows, its obvious that there are missing values in the output sequence (<span class=\"math-container\">$y_4$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\">$y_6$</span> would be the outputs). And since there is no useful reason to do a seq-to-seq prediction for my problem (as stated previous), I'll ignore that case for now.\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/gHfGy.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/gHfGy.png\" alt=\"inputshape (2,3,x)\"></a></p>\n\n<p>As there is a good reason to use batches to train RNNs (there is an article at machinelearningmastery) and not to update the weights after every sample, I am using a single timestep for each sample. The inputshape is now <span class=\"math-container\">$(batch\\_size, 1, n\\_features)$</span>.\nFor example using a batchsize of 6 the networks calculation should look like this. (For stateful networks the next observation would be <span class=\"math-container\">$x_6, ...$</span> together with the state at <span class=\"math-container\">$x_5$</span>, the batchsize determines when to update the weights during training.)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/RbxGf.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/RbxGf.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<h2>Truncated Backpropagation Through Time</h2>\n\n<p>As stated <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39457744/backpropagation-through-time-in-stateful-rnns%20%22stackoverflow\">in this stackoverflow question</a> the BPTT for keras RNNs is limited to the timelags of the input. Lets have a look at our input shape considering the BPTT.\nFor a higher order of lags, the error is back-propagated through time.\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/FTwem.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/FTwem.png\" alt=\"bptt n lags\"></a></p>\n\n<p>For the approach, where the input is \n<span class=\"math-container\">$(batch\\_size, 1, n\\_features)$</span> there is basically no BPTT, because it stops at one. And I think, that the weights of the recurrent connection are not updated at all, are they?\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/EYl81.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/EYl81.png\" alt=\"BPTT for 1 lag\"></a></p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion and Question</h2>\n\n<p>Learning with a timelag of one might not be a good idea (mainly because of the insufficient BPTT, as the states can be preserved). Working with a higher order of timelags leads into a) holes in the output data using no rolling-windows while generating the samples or b) the time sequence is messed up.</p>\n\n<p>What is a good approach to archive BPTT with Keras LSTMs, predicting future values (one-step and recursive multistep prediction as will) and still keep the input data stream-like (one observation after another)?\nDoes some one have experienced similar problems and if so, how did you solve it? </p>\n\n<p>I'm thankful for every input and maybe I also could help someone who is working on similar stuff ;) </p>\n\n<h2>My theoretical solution</h2>\n\n<p>While writing this question, I had this idea:</p>\n\n<p>As far as i understand the Keras Layers, I can use <em>TimeDistributed</em> Outputlayer to have the Outputlayer applied to every given lag and the networks returns the sequence. (seq-to-seq network)</p>\n\n<pre><code>input = Input(batch_shape=(batch_size, timelags, features))\nlstm = LSTM(units=10, return_sequences=True)(input)\nout = TimeDistributed(Dense(units=features))(lstm)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To avoid messing up the sequence, I do not use a rolling-window. The Input/Outputs are (for lags=3) <span class=\"math-container\">$([x_0,x_1,x_2], [x_1, x_2, x_3]),([x_3, x_4, x_4],[x_4, x_5, x_6])...)$</span>\nAfter I have trained the model I build a new one, which has the same architecture, but the inputshpape <span class=\"math-container\">$(1, 1, features)$</span> and copy the trained parameters. This works, because the each LSTM- and outputpart as shown in the image are the actually the same (it shows the unrolled version of the lstm) and there is no need for BPTT while predicting, so no need to keep timelags > one and as the network is stateful the hiddenstates are preserved and the output should be the same as if I use a higher order of timelags with a sequence as output.</p>\n\n<pre><code>prediction_model.set_weights(trained_model.get_weights())\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This way the BPTT is used and the input can be fed as stream of single points in time while predicting(I'm testing it now).\n <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/NhNNn.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/NhNNn.png\" alt=\"bptt\"></a></p>\n"

And now my problem looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#Training Data\ntrain = genfromtxt(os.getcwd() + \"/Data/trainMatrix.csv\", delimiter=',', skip_header=1)\nvalidation = genfromtxt(os.getcwd() + \"/Data/validationMatrix.csv\", delimiter=',', skip_header=1)\n\n#Targets\nminiTrainTargets = [int(x) for x in genfromtxt(os.getcwd() + \"/Data/trainTarget.csv\", delimiter=',', skip_header=1)]\nvalidationTargets = [int(x) for x in genfromtxt(os.getcwd() + \"/Data/validationTarget.csv\", delimiter=',', skip_header=1)]\n\n#LSTM\nmodel = Sequential()\nmodel.add(Embedding(train.shape[0], 64, input_length=train.shape[1]))\nmodel.add(LSTM(64)) \nmodel.add(Dropout(0.5))\nmodel.add(Dense(1))\nmodel.add(Activation('sigmoid'))\n\n# try using different optimizers and different optimizer configs\nmodel.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy',\n          optimizer='adam',\n          class_mode=\"binary\")\n\nmodel.fit(train, miniTrainTargets, batch_size=batch_size, nb_epoch=5,\n      validation_data=(validation, validationTargets), show_accuracy=True)\nvalid_preds = model.predict_proba(validation, verbose=0)\nroc = metrics.roc_auc_score(validationTargets, valid_preds)\nprint(\"ROC:\", roc)\nROC:0.5006526\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The model is basically the same as the IMDB one. Though the result means it's not learning anything. However, when I use a vanilla MLP-NN I don't have the same problem, the model learns and the score increases. I tried increasing the number of epochs and increasing-decreasing the number of LTSM units but the score won't increase.</p>\n\n<p>So I would like to know a standard approach to tuning the network because in theory the algorithm should perform better than a multilayer perceptron network specially for this time series data.</p>\n"

If that is the case, then I'd need more 260.13 MB to train this model with 128 images/mini-batch.</p>\n<p>Can you help me understand the memory considerations for training my deep learning model?

My colleague specializes in writing complex functions and stored procedures to methodically process incoming data so that it can be standardized and put to work in reports, visualizations, and analytics projects. Prior to starting here, I had very little experience with SQL, aside from writing the most basic of queries. The vast majority of my analysis prep work was all done in R. My boss insists that I improve my SQL skills, even though there seem to be very few assignments that can't be done more efficiently and with far fewer lines of code using R packages like dplyr, data.table, and tidyr (to name a few). My question is--does this make sense?</p>\n\n<p>A couple weeks ago, I found myself faced with the task of getting a list of column names for each row in a table that met certain criteria and concatenating them into a vector of strings. There was a tight deadline and at the time, I was experiencing some blockage and couldn't quite wrap my head around the problem. I asked my boss, who in turn asked my colleague to write a script TSQL to solve the problem. While he was working on it, I figured out a way to do it in R writing a fairly simple function and applying it over the data frame. My colleague came back with his script about two hours later. It was at least 75 lines comprising two nested for loops. I asked him to tell notify when it was finished running and he said it would take several hours. Meanwhile my R script was able to loop over the ~45,000 records in about 30 seconds.</p>\n\n<p>Am I right to assume that R is a much better choice for cleaning and munging data?  Maybe the SQL developer in my office is just inept?  I'm curious if anyone who has worked with both R and SQL (or Python and SQL for that matter) have any thoughts on this.</p>\n"

    "body": "<p>I’m posting this question, <a href=\"https://meta.stackexchange.com/help/self-answer\">and an answer</a>, to help dispel a few misunderstandings about what p-values are. As a hiring manager interviewing mid-level and senior data scientists, I have noticed these misunderstandings many times. I have also noticed several posts here on DS.SE where the poster has misinterpreted, or misunderstood, p-values, so rather than point it out every time with details, I thought it better to make a question and answer on the topic. The intention is to hopefully create a &quot;canonical&quot; Q&amp;A that the community can refer to, if/when appropriate. I would welcome any comments in case I have made any mistakes.</p>\n<p>What follows is very heavily based on the paper by Haller and Krauss (2002) who investigated misconceptions about null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) among three groups: psychology students, scientific psychologists, and methodology instructors teaching statistics to Psychology students German universities. They used a survey consisting of six statements about the interpretation of a p-value derived from a t-test. Participants were asked to classify each statement as &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>A questionnaire:</h3>\n<p>Suppose you have a treatment that you suspect may alter performance on a task. You compare the means of your control and experimental groups (say 20 subjects in each sample). Then, you use an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test#Independent_(unpaired)_samples\" rel=\"noreferrer\">independent means t-test</a> and your result is (t = 2.7, d.f. = 18, p = 0.01). Please choose &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;, and  note that several or none of the statements may be correct.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You have disproved the null hypothesis (that is, there is no difference between the population means).</li>\n<li>You have found the probability of the null hypothesis being true.</li>\n<li>You have proved your experimental hypothesis (that there is a difference between the population means).</li>\n<li>You can deduce the probability of the experimental hypothesis being true.</li>\n<li>You know, if you decide to reject the null hypothesis, the probability that you are making the wrong decision.</li>\n<li>You have a reliable experimental finding in the sense that if, hypothetically, the experiment were repeated a great number of times, you would obtain a significant result on 99% of occasions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I would encourage everyone reading this to think deeply about these questions and come up with their answers, <strong>before</strong> reading my answer which follows.

    "body": "<p>I'm not an expert in autoencoders or neural networks by any means, so forgive me if this is a silly question. </p>\n\n<p>For the purpose of dimension reduction or visualizing clusters in high dimensional data, we can use an autoencoder to create a (lossy) 2 dimensional representation by inspecting the output of the network layer with 2 nodes. For example, with the following architecture, we would inspect the output of the third layer</p>\n\n<p>$[X] \\rightarrow N_1=100 \\rightarrow N_2=25 \\rightarrow (N_3=2) \\rightarrow N_4=25 \\rightarrow N_5=100 \\rightarrow [X]$</p>\n\n<p>where $X$ is the input data and $N_l$ is the number of nodes in the $l$th layer.</p>\n\n<p>Now, my question is, why do we want a symmetrical architecture? Doesn't a mirror of the deep 'compression' phase mean we might have a similarly complex 'decompression' phase resulting in a 2 node output which is not forced to be very intuitive? In other words, wouldn't having a simpler decoding phase result in the output of the layer with 2 nodes necessarily being simpler too?</p>\n\n<p>My thinking here is that the less complex the decompression phase, the simpler (more linear?) the 2D representation has to be. A more complex decompression phase would allow a more complex 2D representation.</p>\n"

The problem is that this target is circular, $0$ and $360$ degrees are exactly the same which is an invariance I would like to incorporate in my target, which should help generalization significantly (this is my assumption). The problem is that I don't see a clean way of solving this, are there any papers that try to tackle this problem (or similar ones)? I do have some ideas with their potential downsides:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Use a sigmoid or tanh activation, scale it to the ($0, 2\\pi)$ range and incorporate the circular property in the loss function. I think this will fail fairly hard, because if it's on the border (worst prediction) only a tiny bit of noise will push the weights to go one way or the other. Also, values closer to the border of $0$ and $2\\pi$ will be more difficult to reach because the absolute pre-activation value will need to be close to infinite.</p></li>\n<li><p>Regress to two values, a $x$ and $y$ value and calculate the loss based on the angle these two values make. I think this one has more potential but the norm of this vector is unbounded, which could lead to numeric instability and could lead to blow ups or going to 0 during training. This could potentially be solved by using some weird regularizer to prevent this norm from going too far away from 1.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Other options would be doing something with sine and cosine functions but I feel like the fact that multiple pre-activations map to the same output will also make optimization and generalizations very difficult.</p>\n"

    "body": "<p>The question of whether to use macro- or micro-averages when the data is imbalanced comes up all the time.</p>\n\n<p>Some googling shows that many bloggers tend to say that micro-average is the preferred way to go, e.g.:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/usf-msds/choosing-the-right-metric-for-evaluating-machine-learning-models-part-2-86d5649a5428\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Micro-average is preferable if there is a class imbalance problem.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://rushdishams.blogspot.com/2011/08/micro-and-macro-average-of-precision.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">On the other hand, micro-average can be a useful measure when your dataset varies in size.</a></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/15989/micro-average-vs-macro-average-performance-in-a-multiclass-classification-settin\">similar question in this forum</a> suggests a similar answer.</p>\n\n<p>However, this seems quite counter-intuitive. For example if we have a data set with 90%-10% class distribution then a baseline classifier can achieve 90% mico-averaged accuracy by assigning the majority class label. </p>\n\n<p>This is corroborated by books, e.g. <a href=\"https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">An Introduction to Information Retrieval</a> says (page 282) \"Microaveraged results are therefore really a measure of effectiveness on the large classes in a test collection.  To get a sense of effectiveness on small classes, you should compute macroaveraged results.\"</p>\n\n<p>In the end the real decision about which measure to use should be based on the relative mis-classification costs for the classes. But a quick look at the internet seems to suggest use of micro-averaging. Is this correct or misleading?</p>\n"

Here is one of its responses to the question:</p>\n<p><em>&quot;As a language model, ChatGPT does not have a decoder-only architecture, it has an encoder-decoder architecture. Having an encoder-decoder architecture enables language models like ChatGPT to process input sequences and generate outputs based on that input. The encoder processes the input sequence and generates a set of hidden states, which are then used by the decoder to generate the output sequence.\nHaving both an encoder and a decoder allows ChatGPT to handle a variety of tasks that involve generating text based on input text, such as language translation, summarization, and answering questions. Having an encoder-decoder architecture allows ChatGPT to maintain context and consistency in the generated output, which is important for many NLP tasks.\nIt is possible to train a decoder-only language model, but it would be limited in its ability to generate coherent text as it would not have access to the context provided by the encoder.&quot;</em></p>\n<p>However, I have been under the definite impression for quite some time now that GPT-3 (from which ChatGPT was in part derived) is a decoder-only model. And I take with a grain of salt ChatGPT's explanation of its own architecture given that it seems prone to generating incorrect answers sometimes. Also, with the huge fanfare of ChatGPT and the potential for misinformed authors writing about the model, I wonder if anyone knows of a reliable source that can clarify this question.</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>\n"

Then they have to, in some ill-defined way, construct the classifier to make up for biasing the sample. It is simply the case that a classifier trained to a 1/2 prevalence situation will not be applicable to a population with a 1/1000 prevalence. The classifier would have to be re-trained on the new sample, and the patterns detected may change greatly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fharrell.com/post/class-damage/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Damage Caused by Classification Accuracy and Other Discontinuous Improper Accuracy Scoring Rules</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As discusssed here, fans of “classifiers” sometimes subsample from observations in the most frequent outcome category (here Y=1) to get an artificial 50/50 balance of Y=0 and Y=1 when developing their classifier. Fans of such deficient notions of accuracy fail to realize that their classifier will not apply to a population when a much different prevalence of Y=1 than 0.5.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/f2harrell/status/1499369999890370566\" rel=\"noreferrer\">&quot;People are still pushing ridiculous methods like SMOTE.&quot;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/f2harrell/status/1062424969366462473?lang=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">&quot;Don't mess with the data.

What do the statisticians miss about class imbalance that makes it problematic in data science?</p>\n<p>An answer like, &quot;You could get 99% accuracy just by classifying everything in the majority class,&quot; really speaks to why accuracy is a problematic measure of performance, which is most obvious in, <a href=\"https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/312787/247274\">but not exclusive to</a>, situations with imbalance.

However, or perhaps I have misunderstood/missed the explanation from the article, it doesn't say what exactly is the input. </p>\n\n<p>For example, I have (parent) node A (with 50 inputs) splitting into node B and node C. Now, say of the 50 inputs there are 7 missing values. </p>\n\n<p>The other 43 inputs are split into B and C accordingly. What I seem to be understanding is that, it will allocate the remaining 7 into B and C and determine which one gives a higher gain score; that will be the optimal direction. </p>\n\n<p>However, given the 7 values are missing (Which means I don't know what are these 7 values), how does allocating missing values into any of the child nodes change the gain score, or rather minimize the loss function? This seems to suggest that Xgboost is inputting something for the missing values. I can't seem to find out what is Xgboost inputting for these missing values. I hope this question isn't too vague/general and easy. </p>\n\n<p>Edit: I think \"Missing values\" may be a vague term. What I meant here is (From wiki) \"In statistics, missing data, or missing values, occur when no data value is stored for the variable in an observation.\" </p>\n\n<p>From the author himself (<a href=\"https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/issues/21\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/issues/21</a>), he said\n\" tqchen commented on Aug 13, 2014\nxgboost naturally accepts sparse feature format, you can directly feed data in as sparse matrix, and only contains non-missing value.</p>\n\n<p>i.e. features that are not presented in the sparse feature matrix are treated as 'missing'. XGBoost will handle it internally and you do not need to do anything on it.\"</p>\n\n<p>And,</p>\n\n<p>\" tqchen commented on Aug 13, 2014\nInternally, XGBoost will automatically learn what is the best direction to go when a value is missing. Equivalently, this can be viewed as automatically \"learn\" what is the best imputation value for missing values based on reduction on training loss.\"</p>\n"

But beyond this I can't find any decent heuristics for how exactly to pick the number.

Surely each \"dimension\" should have sufficient examples to be learnt? </p>\n\n<p>I have a collection of 200 000 documents, averaging about 20 pages in length each, covering a vocabulary of most of the English language.

Who can explain me why we should use both of them in any real application? and why performance improve when we use both of them?</p>\n"

I use a database of job listings to achieve this. At the moment, the code works as follows:</p>\n\n<p>1) Process the text of each job listing to extract skills that are mentioned in the listing</p>\n\n<p>2) For each career (e.g. \"Data Analyst\"), combine the processed text of the job listings for that career into one document</p>\n\n<p>3) Calculate the TF-IDF of each skill within the career documents</p>\n\n<p>After this, I'm not sure which method I should use to rank careers based on a list of a user's skills.

For that matter, TF-IDF doesn't seem like the appropriate metric to apply to the user's skill list at all. For instance, if a user adds additional skills to their list, the TF for each skill will drop. In reality, I don't care what the frequency of the skills are in the user's skills list -- I just care that they have those skills (and maybe how well they know those skills).</p>\n\n<p>It seems like a better metric would be to do the following:</p>\n\n<p>1) For each skill that the user has, calculate the TF-IDF of that skill in the career documents</p>\n\n<p>2) For each career, sum the TF-IDF results for all of the user's skill</p>\n\n<p>3) Rank career based on the above sum</p>\n\n<p>Am I thinking along the right lines here? If so, are there any algorithms that work along these lines, but are more sophisticated than a simple sum? Thanks for the help!</p>\n"

However, I am still confused about the weights. </p>\n\n<p>In a normal neural network, each neuron has its own weight. In the fully connected layer, each neuron would also have its own weight.

    "title": "Why my network needs so many epochs to learn?",
    "body": "<p>I'm working on a relation classification task for natural language processing and I have some questions about the learning process. I implemented a convolutional neural network using PyTorch, and I'm trying to select the best hyper-parameters.</p>\n\n<p>The common behaviour I noticed is that even after 1000 epochs, my validation loss is still slowly decreasing, and my metric (macro F1 score) is slowly increasing. Both the metrics are oscillating, perhaps due to the imbalance of the 4 classes to classify (5%, 3%, 30%, 62%). I'm using Adam, so the learning rate is not set by myself (it is adaptive). I'm using dropout 0.5 after max pooling, and mini batches of size 50.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/X3Vpc.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/X3Vpc.png\" alt=\"The train and validation loss during the 1000 epochs\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/H7SQW.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/H7SQW.png\" alt=\"The macro f1 score during the 1000 epochs\"></a></p>\n\n<p>On books and online tutorials I have seen plots that are so clear in when to stop training. For instance, when the train loss becomes less that the validation loss, or when a plateau is reached in the validation loss. This seems not to be the case, so I'm asking for an advice to more navigated neural network users:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Why the network is still learning after so many epochs (and so slowly)? It is a reasonable behaviour? Do I need to run the model for 2000, or even 3000 epochs to get the best macro f1 score? It risks to overfit, doesn't it?</li>\n<li>My network is fed by word embeddings and position embeddings only, so I'm wondering if this behaviour can be motivated by (i) a network architecture that is too complex for the task, (ii) a network architecture that is too simple to model the complexity for the task, (iii) the inputs are not so informative to discriminate the classes, so the network learns with difficulty (and thus slowly). My network architecture is not deep: it has an embedding layer + conv layer + max-pool layer + softmax.</li>\n<li>A side question: suppose 1000 epochs are enough. When I need to compare performance of many models (or to compare different hyper-parameter combinations), which score I need to pick and compare? The \"last best\" f1 score (say at epoch 980) or the last reported score (i.e., the one at epoch 1000)?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Do you have any suggestions? Let me know if something is unclear!</p>\n\n<p>=====</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong></p>\n\n<p>Following the advice by <strong>Djib2011</strong> I trained the network with different learning rates, in particular <code>lr=0.001</code> (the default), <code>lr=0.01</code>, <code>lr=0.1</code>. I trained the network using even more epochs (i.e., 3000), to identify the moment in which I could stop the training. What I noticed is that increasing the learning rate doesn't help, and the best results are given by the default <code>lr=0.001</code>. However it is still unclear when to stop.</p>\n\n<p>Do you have other advices to tackle this problem? Besides learning rates, there could be other issues behind the optimizer (e.g., network with a small capacity)? Thank you in advance!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/kjual.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/kjual.png\" alt=\"Report using different learning rates\"></a></p>\n\n<p>=====</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update #2</strong></p>\n\n<p>After experimenting with different optimization algorithms (i.e., RMSProp, AdaDelta, Adamax, SGD) with different learning rates and 3000 epochs, I noticed that the behaviour across these different settings was still the same (no convergence, and many epochs with little decreasing training and validation losses).</p>\n\n<p>I thus modified the pytorch implementation by moving the 3 lines: <code>optimizer.zero_grad()</code>, <code>loss.backward()</code>, <code>optimizer.step()</code> inside the (training) batches loop instead of running them after the loop. As a result, this is the edited code that performs training and testing at each epoch:</p>\n\n<pre><code># Iterate over epochs\nfor epoch in range(1, n_epochs+1):\n    train_loss = 0\n    model.train()\n\n    train_predictions = []\n    train_true_labels = []\n\n    # Iterate over training batches\n    for i, (inputs, labels) in enumerate(train_loader):\n        inputs, labels = Variable(inputs).to(device), Variable(labels).to(device)\n\n        optimizer.zero_grad() # set gradients to zero\n\n        preds = model(inputs)\n        preds.to(device)\n\n        # Compute the loss and accumulate it to print it afterwards\n        loss = loss_criterion(preds, labels)\n        train_loss += loss.detach()\n\n        pred_values, pred_encoded_labels = torch.max(preds.data, 1)\n        pred_encoded_labels = pred_encoded_labels.cpu().numpy()\n\n        train_predictions.extend(pred_encoded_labels)\n        train_true_labels.extend(labels)\n\n        loss.backward()       # backpropagate and compute gradients\n        optimizer.step()      # perform a parameter update\n\n\n    # Evaluate on development test\n    predictions = []\n    true_labels = []\n    dev_loss = 0\n\n    model.eval()\n    for i, (inputs, labels) in enumerate(dev_loader):\n        inputs, labels = Variable(inputs).to(device), Variable(labels).to(device)\n\n        preds = model(inputs)\n        preds.to(device)\n\n        loss = loss_criterion(preds, labels)\n        dev_loss += loss.detach()\n\n        pred_values, pred_encoded_labels = torch.max(preds.data, 1)\n        pred_encoded_labels = pred_encoded_labels.cpu().numpy()\n\n        predictions.extend(pred_encoded_labels)\n        true_labels.extend(labels)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I thus trained again the network using my default configuration (Adam, lr=0.001) and surprisingly I obtained a convergence at epoch 22 (see images below). I think the issue was there, do you agree? Do you have any additional advice? Thanks again!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/RYUhc.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/RYUhc.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/i3tCX.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/i3tCX.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n"

    "title": "Where in the workflow should we deal with missing data?",
    "body": "<p>I'm building a workflow for creating machine learning models (in my case, using Python's <code>pandas</code> and <code>sklearn</code> packages) from data pulled from a very large database (here, Vertica by way of SQL and <code>pyodbc</code>), and a critical step in that process involves imputing missing values of the predictors. This is straightforward within a single analytics or stats platform---be it Python, R, Stata, etc.---but I'm curious where best to locate this step in a multi-platform workflow.</p>\n\n<p>It's simple enough to do this in Python, either with the <a href=\"http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html#imputation-of-missing-values\"><code>sklearn.preprocessing.Imputer</code></a> class, using the <a href=\"http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.13.1/generated/pandas.DataFrame.fillna.html\"><code>pandas.DataFrame.fillna</code></a> method, or by hand (depending upon the complexity of the imputation method used). But since I'm going to be using this for dozens or hundreds of columns across hundreds of millions of records, I wonder if there's a more efficient way to do this directly through SQL ahead of time. Aside from the potential efficiencies of doing this in a distributed platform like Vertica, this would have the added benefit of allowing us to create an automated pipeline for building \"complete\" versions of tables, so we don't need to fill in a new set of missing values from scratch every time we want to run a model.</p>\n\n<p>I haven't been able to find much guidance about this, but I imagine that we could:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>create a table of substitute values (e.g., mean/median/mode, either overall or by group) for each incomplete column</li>\n<li>join the substitute value table with the original table to assign a substitute value for each row and incomplete column</li>\n<li>use a series of case statements to take the original value if available and the substitute value otherwise</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Is this a reasonable thing to do in Vertica/SQL, or is there a good reason not to bother and just handle it in Python instead? And if the latter, is there a strong case for doing this in pandas rather than sklearn or vice-versa? Thanks!</p>\n"

What I'm not a 100% sure of is how the gradient in the next layer gets routed back to the pooling layer.</p>\n\n<p>So the first question is if I have a pooling layer connected to a fully connected layer - like the image below.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/hJUT8.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/hJUT8.png\" alt=\"example1\"></a></p>\n\n<p>When computing the gradient for the cyan \"neuron\" of the pooling layer do I sum all the gradients from the FC layer neurons? If this is correct then every \"neuron\" of the pooling layer has the same gradient?</p>\n\n<p>For example if the first neuron of FC layer has a gradient of 2, second has a gradient of 3, and third a gradient of 6. What are the gradients of the blue and purple \"neurons\" in the pooling layer and why?</p>\n\n<p>And the second question is when the pooling layer is connected to another convolution layer. How do I compute the gradient then? See the example below.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/7N4nM.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/7N4nM.png\" alt=\"example2\"></a></p>\n\n<p>For the topmost rightmost \"neuron\" of the pooling layer (the outlined green one) I just take the gradient of the purple neuron in the next conv layer and route it back, right?</p>\n\n<p>How about the filled green one? I need to multiply together the first column of neurons in the next layer because of the chain rule? Or do I need to add them?</p>\n\n<p>Please do not post a bunch of equations and tell me that my answer is right in there because I've been trying to wrap my head around equations and I still don't understand it perfectly that's why I'm asking this question in a simple way.</p>\n"

So after they calculate the they wouldn't directly use the advantage, but rather would normalize it, e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/ashutoshkrjha/Cartpole-OpenAI-Tensorflow/blob/master/cartpole.py\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> they do after every episode:</p>\n\n<pre><code>discounted_epr = discount_rewards(epr)\ndiscounted_epr -= np.mean(discounted_epr)\ndiscounted_epr /= np.std(discounted_epr)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>what's the justification for that - both in theory and in intuition? It seems to me that if an episode is long and as such has large advantages, it's worth learning more from that episode than from a 3 moves episode. What am I missing? </p>\n"

    "title": "Clustering unique visitors by useragent, ip, session_id",
    "body": "<p>Given website access data in the form <code>session_id, ip, user_agent</code>, and optionally timestamp, following the conditions below, how would you best cluster the sessions into unique visitors?</p>\n\n<p><code>session_id</code>: is an id given to every new visitor. It does not expire, however if the user doesn't accept cookies/clears cookies/changes browser/changes device, he will not be recognised anymore</p>\n\n<p><code>IP</code> can be shared between different users (Imagine a free wi-fi cafe, or your ISP reassigning IPs), and they will often have at least 2, home and work.</p>\n\n<p><code>User_agent</code> is the browser+OS version, allowing to distinguish between devices. For example a user is likely to use both phone and laptop, but is unlikely to use windows+apple laptops. It is unlikely that the same session id has multiple useragents.</p>\n\n<p>Data might look as the fiddle here:\n<a href=\"http://sqlfiddle.com/#!2/c4de40/1\">http://sqlfiddle.com/#!2/c4de40/1</a></p>\n\n<p>Of course, we are talking about assumptions, but it's about getting as close to reality as possible. For example, if we encounter the same ip and useragent in a limited time frame with a different session_id, it would be a fair assumption that it's the same user, with some edge case exceptions.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Language in which the problem is solved is irellevant, it's mostly about logic and not implementation. Pseudocode is fine.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: due to the slow nature of the fiddle, you can alternatively read/run the mysql:</p>\n\n<pre><code>select session_id, floor(rand()*256*256*256*256) as ip_num , floor(rand()*1000) as user_agent_id\nfrom \n    (select 1+a.nr+10*b.nr as session_id, ceil(rand()*3) as nr\n    from\n        (select 1 as nr union all select 2 union all select 3   union all select 4 union all select 5\n        union all select 6 union all select 7 union all select 8 union all select 9 union all select 0)a\n    join\n        (select 1 as nr union all select 2 union all select 3   union all select 4 union all select 5\n        union all select 6 union all select 7 union all select 8 union all select 9 union all select 0)b\n        order by 1\n    )d\ninner join\n    (select 1 as nr union all select 2 union all select 3   union all select 4 union all select 5\n    union all select 6 union all select 7 union all select 8 union all select 9 )e\n    on d.nr&gt;=e.nr\n</code></pre>\n"

So, when I find the same value for such an attribute, I will know that the two descriptions are most likely about the same entity (e.g. the same person).</p>\n\n<p>For example, the attribute \"lastName\" is more discriminative than the attribute \"nationality\". </p>\n\n<p><strong>How could I (statistically) find such attributes that are more important than others?</strong></p>\n\n<p>A naive solution would be to take the average IDF of the values of each attribute and make this the \"importance\" factor of the attribute.

Essentially, I would my dataset to be in a numerical format so that I can work on implementing the models. </p>\n\n<p>In the data set, there are categorical columns like education, marital status, working class etc. Can someone tell me how to convert them into numerical columns in pyspark?  </p>\n\n<pre><code>workclass = {'?':0,'Federal-gov':1,'Local-gov':2,'Never-  worked':3,'Private':4,'Self-emp-inc':5,'Self-emp-not-inc':6,'State-gov':7,'Without-pay':8}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I created a sample dictionary with key value pairs for work class.

    "body": "<p>I have read that HMMs, Particle Filters and Kalman filters are special cases of dynamic Bayes networks. However, I only know HMMs and I don't see the difference to dynamic Bayes networks.</p>\n\n<p>Could somebody please explain?</p>\n\n<p>It would be nice if your answer could be similar to the following, but for bayes Networks:</p>\n\n<h2>Hidden Markov Models</h2>\n\n<p>A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a 5-tuple $\\lambda = (S, O, A, B, \\Pi)$:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>$S \\neq \\emptyset$: A set of states (e.g. \"beginning of phoneme\", \"middle of phoneme\", \"end of phoneme\")</li>\n<li>$O \\neq \\emptyset$: A set of possible observations (audio signals)</li>\n<li>$A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{|S| \\times |S|}$: A stochastic matrix which gives probabilites $(a_{ij})$ to get from state $i$ to state $j$.</li>\n<li>$B \\in \\mathbb{R}^{|S| \\times |O|}$: A stochastic matrix which gives probabilites $(b_{kl})$ to get in state $k$ the observation $l$.</li>\n<li>$\\Pi \\in \\mathbb{R}^{|S|}$: Initial distribution to start in one of the states.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It is usually displayed as a directed graph, where each node corresponds to one state $s \\in S$ and the transition probabilities are denoted on the edges.</p>\n\n<p>Hidden Markov Models are called \"hidden\", because the current state is hidden. The algorithms have to guess it from the observations and the model itself. They are called \"Markov\", because for the next state only the current state matters.</p>\n\n<p>For HMMs, you give a fixed topology (number of states, possible edges). Then there are 3 possible tasks</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Evaluation</strong>: given a HMM $\\lambda$, how likely is it to get observations $o_1, \\dots, o_t$ (Forward algorithm)</li>\n<li><strong>Decoding</strong>: given a HMM $\\lambda$ and a observations $o_1, \\dots, o_t$, what is the most likely sequence of states $s_1, \\dots, s_t$ (Viterbi algorithm)</li>\n<li><strong>Learning</strong>: learn $A, B, \\Pi$: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baum%E2%80%93Welch_algorithm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Baum-Welch algorithm</a>, which is a special case of Expectation maximization.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Bayes networks</h2>\n\n<p>Bayes networks are directed acyclical graphs (DAGs) $G = (\\mathcal{X}, \\mathcal{E})$. The nodes represent random variables $X \\in \\mathcal{X}$. For every $X$, there is a probability distribution which is conditioned on the parents of $X$:</p>\n\n<p>$$P(X|\\text{parents}(X))$$</p>\n\n<p>There seem to be (please clarify) two tasks:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Inference</strong>: Given some variables, get the most likely values of the others variables. Exact inference is NP-hard. Approximately, you can use MCMC.</li>\n<li><p><strong>Learning</strong>: How you learn those distributions depends on the exact problem (<a href=\"http://www.eng.tau.ac.il/~bengal/BN.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">source</a>):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>known structure, fully observable:  maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)</li>\n<li>known structure, partially observable: Expectation Maximization (EM) or Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)</li>\n<li>unknown structure, fully observable: search through model space</li>\n<li>unknown structure, partially observable: EM + search through model space</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Dynamic Bayes networks</h2>\n\n<p>I guess dynamic Bayes networks (DBNs) are also directed probabilistic graphical models. The variability seems to come from the network changing over time. However, it seems to me that this is equivalent to only copying the same network and connecting every node at time $t$ with every the corresponding node at time $t+1$. Is that the case?</p>\n"

    "title": "Preprocessing for Text Classification in Transformer Models (BERT variants)",
    "body": "<p>This might be silly to ask, but I am wondering if one should carry out the conventional text preprocessing steps for training one of the transformer models?</p>\n<p>I remember for training a Word2Vec or Glove, we needed to perform an extensive text cleaning like: tokenize, remove stopwords, remove punctuations, stemming or lemmatization and more. However, during last few days I have had a quick jump into transformer models (fascinated btw), and what I have noticed that most of these models have a built-in tokenizer (cool), but none of the demos, examples, or tutorials are performing any of the these text preprocessing steps. You may take <a href=\"https://github.com/kaushaltrivedi/fast-bert\" rel=\"noreferrer\">fast-bert</a> for instance, there are no text preprocessing involved for the demos (maybe it is just a demo), but at <a href=\"https://github.com/kaushaltrivedi/fast-bert#5-model-inference\" rel=\"noreferrer\">inference</a> the whole sentences are passed without any cleaning:</p>\n<pre><code>texts = ['I really love the Netflix original movies',\n         'this movie is not worth watching']\npredictions = learner.predict_batch(texts)\n</code></pre>\n<p>The same is true for the <a href=\"https://github.com/huggingface/transformers\" rel=\"noreferrer\">original transformer</a> by HuggingFace. Or many tutorials that I have looked at (take <a href=\"https://github.com/kaushaltrivedi/bert-toxic-comments-multilabel/blob/master/toxic-bert-multilabel-classification.ipynb\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this</a> or <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/building-a-multi-label-text-classifier-using-bert-and-tensorflow-f188e0ecdc5d\" rel=\"noreferrer\">another one</a>). I can imagine that depending on the task this might not be required, e.g. next work prediction or machine translation and more. More importantly I think this is part of the contextual-based approach that these models offer (that is the innovation so to say) that are meant to keep most of the text and we may obtain a minimum but still good representation of the each token (out of vocabulary word). Borrowed from <a href=\"https://medium.com/huggingface/multi-label-text-classification-using-bert-the-mighty-transformer-69714fa3fb3d\" rel=\"noreferrer\">medium article</a> by HuggingFace:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Tokenisation</strong>\nBERT-Base, uncased uses a vocabulary of 30,522 words. The\nprocesses of tokenisation involves splitting the input text into list\nof tokens that are available in the vocabulary. In order to deal with\nthe words not available in the vocabulary, BERT uses a technique\ncalled BPE based WordPiece tokenisation. In this approach an out of\nvocabulary word is progressively split into subwords and the word is\nthen represented by a group of subwords. Since the subwords are part\nof the vocabulary, we have learned representations an context for\nthese subwords and the context of the word is simply the combination\nof the context of the subwords.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But does that hold true for tasks like multi-label text classification? In my use case the text is full of not useful stopwords, punctuation, characters and abbreviations and it is multi-label text classification as mentioned earlier. And in fact the prediction accuracy is not good (after a few rounds of training using <a href=\"https://github.com/kaushaltrivedi/fast-bert\" rel=\"noreferrer\">fast-bert</a>). What do I miss here?</p>\n"

    "body": "<p>I know someone who is working on a project that involves ingesting files of data without regard to the columns or data types. The task is to take a file with any number of columns and various data types and output summary statistics on the numerical data.</p>\n\n<p>However, he is unsure of how to go about dynamically assigning data types for certain number-based data. For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    CITY\n    Albuquerque\n    Boston\n    Chicago\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is obviously not numerical data and will be stored as text.

This clearly wouldn't work, but it was an idea.</li>\n<li>If a column has fewer than <em>n</em> unique values and is numeric, label it categorical. This might be closer, but there could still be issues with numerical data falling through.</li>\n<li>Maintain a list of common numeric data that should actually be categorical and compare the column headers to this list for matches. For example, anything with \"ZIP\" in it would be categorical.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>My gut tells me that there is no way to accurately assign numeric data as categorical or numerical, but was hoping for a suggestion. Any insight you have is greatly appreciated.</p>\n"

Instead, we give it a probability of having a certain type.</p>\n\n<pre><code>  A 0.2    A 0.0    A 0.1\n  B 0.5    B 0.5    B 0.9     etc.\n  C 0.0    C 0.0    C 0.0\n  D 0.3    D 0.5    D 0.0\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here is an abstract graphic of what I want to achieve:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/e2njr.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<h3>Solution considered A: Convolution of a patch of tokens</h3>\n\n<p>This solution consists in applying a convolution with several patches of tokens, and take the one that creates the least conflicts.</p>\n\n<p>The hard part here is to find potential patches to roll along the observe sequence.\nFew ideas for this one, but nothing very satisfying:</p>\n\nBuild a Markov model of the transition between tokens\n\n<p>Drawback: since a Markov model has no memory, we will lose the orders of transition.\ne.g. If the repeated sequence is <code>A B C B D</code>, we lose the fact that A->B occurs before C->B.</p>\n\nBuild a suffix tree\n\n<p>This seems to be used extensively in biology in order to analyse nucleobases (GTAC) in DNA/RNA.\nDrawback: Suffix trees are good for exact matching of exact tokens (e.g. characters). We have neither exact sequences, nor exact tokens.</p>\n\nBrute force\n\n<p>Try every combination of every size. Could actually work, but would take some (long (long)) time.</p>\n\n<h3>Solution considered B: Build a table of Levenshtein distances of suffixes</h3>\n\n<p>The intuition is that there may exist some local minima of distance when computing the distance from every suffix to every suffix.</p>\n\n<p>The distance function is the Levenshtein distance, but we will be able to customize it in the future in order to take in account the probability of being of a certain types, instead of having a fixed type for each token.</p>\n\n<p>In order to stay simple in that demonstration, we will use fixed-type tokens, and use the classic Levenshtein to compute the distance between tokens.</p>\n\n<p>e.g. Let's have the input sequence <code>ABCGDEFGH ABCDEFGH ABCDNEFGH</code>.</p>\n\n<p>We compute the distance of every suffix with every suffix (cropped to be of equal size):</p>\n\n<pre><code>for i = 0 to sequence.lengh\n  for j = i to sequence.lengh\n    # Create the suffixes\n    suffixA = sequence.substr(i)\n    suffixB = sequence.substr(j)\n    # Make the suffixes the same size\n    chunkLen = Math.min(suffixA.length, suffixB.length)\n    suffixA = suffixA.substr(0, chunkLen)\n    suffixB = suffixB.substr(0, chunkLen)\n    # Compute the distance\n    distance[i][j] = LevenshteinDistance(suffixA, suffixB)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We get e.g. the following result (white is small distance, black is big):</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/VFTBZ.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Now, it's obvious that any suffix compared to itself will have a null distance. But we are not interested by suffix (exactly or partially) matching itself, so we crop that part.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ypYa8.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Since the suffixes are cropped to the same size, comparing long string will always yield a bigger distance than comparing smaller strings.</p>\n\n<p>We need to compensate that by a smooth penalty starting from the right (+P), fading out linearly to the left.</p>\n\n<p>I am not sure yet how to choose a good penalty function that would fit all cases.</p>\n\n<p>Here we apply a (+P=6) penalty on the extreme right, fading out to 0 to the left.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ccFge.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Now we can clearly see 2 clear diagonal lines emerge. There are 3 Items (Item1, Item2, Item3) in that sequence. The longest line represents the matching between Item1 vs Item2 and Item2 vs Item3. The second longest represents the matching between Item1 vs Item3.</p>\n\n<p>Now I am not sure on the best way to exploit that data. Is it as simple as taking the highest diagonal lines?</p>\n\n<p>Let's assume it is.</p>\n\n<p>Let's compute the average value of the diagonal line that start from each token.\nWe can see the result on the following picture (the vector below the matrix) :</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/PXoP7.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>There are clearly 3 local minima, that match the beginning of each Item.\nLooks fantastic!</p>\n\n<p>Now let's add some more imperfections in the sequence:\n<code>ABCGDEFGH ABCDEFGH TROLL ABCDEFGH</code></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/D2oYi.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Clearly now, our vector of diagonal averages is messed up, and we cannot exploit it anymore...</p>\n\n<p>My assumption is that this could be solved by a customized distance function (instead of Levenshtein), where the insertion of a whole block may not be so much penalized. That is what I am not sure of.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>None of the explored convolution-based solutions seem to fit our problem.</p>\n\n<p>The Levenshtein-distance-based solution seems promising, especially because it is compatible with probability-based-type tokens. But I am not sure yet about how to exploit the results of it.</p>\n\n<p>I would be very grateful if you have experience in a related field, and a couple of good hints to give us, or other techniques to explore.\nThank you very much in advance.</p>\n"

However, in my experience, boosting tree regression works less well when I use normalized features, for some strange reason. How is your experience using feature normalization with boosted trees does it in general improve our models?</p>\n"

This paper mainly describes using the sigmoid activation function, which makes sense. However, it seems to me that feeding an input from the normalized distribution produced by the batch normalization into a ReLU activation function of $max(0,x)$ is risky if $\\beta$ does not learn to shift most of the inputs past 0 such that the ReLU isn't losing input information. I.e. if the input to the ReLU were just standard normalized, we would lose a lot of our information below 0. Is there any guarantee or initialization of $\\beta$ that will guarantee that we don't lose this information? Am I missing something with how the operation of BN and ReLU work?</p>\n"

This means the gradient for our network won't be magnified as much, resulting in a lot less variance as we train our network.</p>\n<p>So, without this <span class=\"math-container\">$\\frac{1}{N}$</span>were we lucky to select the least likely sample (<span class=\"math-container\">$0.1$</span>), the gradient would be scaled 10 times.  It would be even worse with smaller values, say <span class=\"math-container\">$0.00001$</span> chance, if our experience replay has many thousands entries, which is quite usual.</p>\n<p>In other words, <span class=\"math-container\">$\\frac{1}{N}$</span> is just to make your hyperparameters (such as learning-rate) not require adjustment, when there you change the size of your experience replay buffer.</p>\n"

This obviously depends on the design of your network.

    "body": "<p>I’m a data science student and I’ve begun working with an open mental health dataset. As part of this, I need to clean the data so that I can perform an analysis of it.</p>\n<p>In this dataset, the gender field is a string that could have had anything entered into it. While cleaning most entries are fairly straightforward (“f”, “F”, “female”, “cis female” and “woman” can all be coded to “F”), what I was wondering about was how to properly handle trans or queer identities (e.g. an entry that says something like “trans female” or “queer/she/they”).</p>\n<p>Should I create a new code for trans entries for each gender, or should I just code them as though they were members of the gender they identify as?</p>\n<p>Should I just drop them from the dataset entirely, because they might distort it? I remember reading that trans individuals suffer from much higher rates of mental illness than cis individuals.</p>\n<p>Are there any best practices that I should follow in this regard?</p>\n"

I don't understand why BERT became the default in research circles when all anyone hears about publicly is GPT-2,3,4 or more recently LLAMA-2.

However, rather than create models of probabilities like in Naive Bayes or similar classifiers, we want our output to be a set of roughly human-readable rules that can be reviewed and modified by an end user.</p>\n\n<p>Association rule learning looks like the family of algorithms that solves this type of problem, but these algorithms seem to focus on identifying common combinations of features and don't include the concept of a final bucket that those features might point to. For example, our data set looks something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Item A { 4-door, small, steel } =&gt; { sedan }\nItem B { 2-door, big,   steel } =&gt; { truck }\nItem C { 2-door, small, steel } =&gt; { coupe }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I just want the rules that say \"if it's big and a 2-door, it's a truck,\" not the rules that say \"if it's a 4-door it's also small.\" </p>\n\n<p>One workaround I can think of is to simply use association rule learning algorithms and ignore the rules that don't involve an end bucket, but that seems a bit hacky.

    "title": "Preference Matching Algorithm",
    "body": "<p>There's this side project I'm working on where I need to structure a solution to the following problem.</p>\n\n<p>I have two groups of people (clients). Group <code>A</code> intends to buy and group <code>B</code> intends to sell a determined product <code>X</code>. The product has a series of attributes <code>x_i</code>, and my objective is to facilitate the transaction between <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> by matching their preferences. The main idea is to point out to each member of <code>A</code> a corresponding in <code>B</code> whose product better suits his needs, and vice versa.</p>\n\n<p>Some complicating aspects of the problem:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The list of attributes is not finite. The buyer might be interested in a very particular characteristic or some kind of design, which is rare among the population and I can't predict. Can't previously list all the attributes;</p></li>\n<li><p>Attributes might be continuous, binary, or non-quantifiable (ex: price, functionality, design);</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Any suggestion on how to approach this problem and solve it in an automated way?</p>\n\n<p>I would also appreciate some references to other similar problems if possible.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Great suggestions! Many similarities in to the way I'm thinking of approaching the problem.</p>\n\n<p>The main issue on mapping the attributes is that the level of detail to which the product should be described depends on each buyers. Let’s take an example of a car. The product “car” has lots and lots of attributes that range from its performance, mechanical structure, price etc.</p>\n\n<p>Suppose I just want a cheap car, or an electric car. Ok, that's easy to map because they represent main features of this product. But let’s say, for instance, that I want a car with Dual-Clutch transmission or Xenon headlights. Well there might be many cars on the data base with this attributes but I wouldn't ask the seller to fill in this level of detail to their product prior to the information that there is someone looking them. Such a procedure would require every seller fill a complex, very detailed, form just try to sell his car on the platform. Just wouldn't work.</p>\n\n<p>But still, my challenge is to try to be as detailed as necessary in the search to make a good match. So the way I'm thinking is mapping main aspects of the product, those that are probably relevant to everyone, to narrow down de group of potential sellers.</p>\n\n<p>Next step would be a “refined search”. In order to avoid creating a too detailed form I could ask buyers and sellers to write a free text of their specification. And then use some word matching algorithm to find possible matches. Although I understand that this is not a proper solution to the problem because the seller cannot “guess” what the buyer needs. But might get me close.  </p>\n\n<p>The weighting criteria suggested is great. It allows me to quantify the level to which the seller matches the buyer’s needs. The scaling part might be a problem though, because the importance of each attribute varies from client to client. I'm thinking of using some kind of pattern recognition or just asking de buyer to input the level of importance of each attribute.</p>\n"

    "body": "<p>As far as I know the development of algorithms to solve the Frequent Pattern Mining (FPM) problem, the road of improvements have some main checkpoints. Firstly, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apriori_algorithm\">Apriori</a> algorithm was proposed in 1993, by <a href=\"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=170072\">Agrawal et al.</a>, along with the formalization of the problem. The algorithm was able to <em>strip-off</em> some sets from the <code>2^n - 1</code> sets (powerset) by using a lattice to maintain the data. A drawback of the approach was the need to re-read the database to compute the frequency of each set expanded.</p>\n\n<p>Later, on year 1997, <a href=\"http://www.computer.org/csdl/trans/tk/2000/03/k0372-abs.html\">Zaki et al.</a> proposed the algorithm <a href=\"http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Data_Mining_Algorithms_In_R/Frequent_Pattern_Mining/The_Eclat_Algorithm\">Eclat</a>, which <em>inserted</em> the resulting frequency of each set inside the lattice. This was done by adding, at each node of the lattice, the set of transaction-ids that had the items from root to the referred node. The main contribution is that one does not have to re-read the entire dataset to know the frequency of each set, but the memory required to keep such data structure built may exceed the size of the dataset itself.</p>\n\n<p>In 2000, <a href=\"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=335191.335372\">Han et al.</a> proposed an algorithm named <a href=\"http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Data_Mining_Algorithms_In_R/Frequent_Pattern_Mining/The_FP-Growth_Algorithm\">FPGrowth</a>, along with a prefix-tree data structure named FPTree. The algorithm was able to provide significant data compression, while also granting that only frequent itemsets would be yielded (without candidate itemset generation). This was done mainly by sorting the items of each transaction in decreasing order, so that the most frequent items are the ones with the least repetitions in the tree data structure. Since the frequency only descends while traversing the tree in-depth, the algorithm is able to <em>strip-off</em> non-frequent itemsets.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>:</p>\n\n<p><strike>As far as I know, this may be considered a state-of-the-art algorithm, but I'd like to know about other proposed solutions. What other algorithms for FPM are considered \"state-of-the-art\"? What is the <em>intuition</em>/<em>main-contribution</em> of such algorithms?</strike></p>\n\n<p>Is the FPGrowth algorithm still considered \"state of the art\" in frequent pattern mining? If not, what algorithm(s) may extract frequent itemsets from large datasets more efficiently?</p>\n"

    "body": "<p>Google Trends returns weekly data so I have to find a way to merge them with my daily/monthly data. </p>\n\n<p>What I have done so far is to break each serie into daily data, for exemple: </p>\n\n<p>from:</p>\n\n<p>2013-03-03 - 2013-03-09 37</p>\n\n<p>to:</p>\n\n<p>2013-03-03 37 \n2013-03-04 37\n2013-03-05 37\n2013-03-06 37\n2013-03-07 37\n2013-03-08 37\n2013-03-09 37</p>\n\n<p>But this is adding a lot of complexity to my problem. I was trying to predict google searchs from the last 6 months values, or 6 values in monthly data. Daily data would imply a work on 180 past values. (I have 10 years of data so 120 points in monthly data / 500+ in weekly data/ 3500+ in daily data)</p>\n\n<p>The other approach would be to \"merge\" daily data in weekly/monthly data. But some questions arise from this process. Some data can be averaged because their sum represent something. Rainfall for example, the amount of rain in a given week will be the sum of the amounts for each days composing the weeks. </p>\n\n<p>In my case I am dealing with prices, financial rates and other things. For the prices it is common in my field to take volume exchanged into account, so the weekly data would be a weighted average. For financial rates it is a bit more complex a some formulas are involved to build weekly rates from daily rates.  For the other things i don't know the underlying properties. I think those properties are important to avoid meaningless indicators (an average of fiancial rates would be a non-sense for example). </p>\n\n<p>So three questions: </p>\n\n<p><strong>For known and unknown properties, how should I proceed to go from daily to weekly/monthly data ?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I feel like breaking weekly/monthly data into daily data like i've done is somewhat wrong because I am introducing quantities that have no sense in real life. So almost the same question: </p>\n\n<p><strong>For known and unknown properties, how should I proceed to go from weekly/monthly to daily data ?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Last but not least: <strong>when given two time series with different time steps, what is better: Using the Lowest or the biggest time step ?</strong> I think this is a compromise between the number of data and the complexity of the model but I can't see any strong argument to choose between those options. </p>\n\n<p>Edit: if you know a tool (in R Python even Excel) to do it easily it would be very appreciated.</p>\n"

I want to build a new classifier that is the union of some subset of these (e.g. I want to decide on which leaves of a decision tree to give a positive classification).  Of course, in doing so there will be a trade off between sensitivity and positive predictive value.  So I would like to see a ROC curve.  In principle I could do this by enumerating all subsets of the classifiers and computing the resulting sensitivity and PPV.  However, this is prohibitively expensive if n is more than 30 or so.  On the other hand, there are almost certainly some combinations that are not Pareto optimal, so there might be some branch and bound strategy, or something, that avoids most of the computation in many cases.</p>\n\n<p>I would like advice about whether this approach is likely to be fruitful and whether there is any work or if you have any ideas about efficiently computing the ROC curve in the situation above.</p>\n"

The first one gives me a ratio of how active the customer is during the month, and the second one weights the category against the others.</p>\n\n<p>The final table looks like this</p>\n\n<pre><code>|*Identifier*|  *firstCat* | *feature1* | *feature2*  |   {      *(TIME SERIES)*   }\n\nCustomerID  |  ClusterID |  DaysOver30 | DaysOverTotal | Events9AM Events10AM ... \n\n xx | 1 | 0,69 |  0,72 |  0,2   0,13   ...\n\n xx | 2 | 0,11 |  0,28 |  0,1   0,45   ...\n\n xy | 1 | 0,23 |  0,88 |  0,00  0,60   ...\n\n xy | 2 | 0,11 |  0,08 |  1,00  0,00   ...\n\n xy | 3 | 0,10 |  0,04 |  0,40  0,60   ...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The time series variables are the percentage over the total of events per day on each specific category (this means that per each row adding up all variables should be 1). The reason of doing it like that is because for example a time series with events <code>0 0 0 1 0</code> and <code>1 1 1 2 1</code> are completely different, and standardizing to normal would give similar results. And due to high skew between different categories, I check the values on the time series independently with the others.</p>\n\n<p>What I need to do now is to identify these categories (remember, they can be from 1 to x being x any number from 1 to 25) into 3 tags: tag A, tag B and None of Them. Looking at these variables I can manually identify which tag they belong to, and the idea is to identify manually as much as I can and use any classifier algorithm to learn from that and identify all of them.</p>\n\n<p>My idea was to use multiple logistic regressions on the table, but all the variables of the time series are correlated (since they are a linear combination of each other), so I thought I better use a clustering algorithm only over the time series using euclidean distance to categorize the different patterns and use the result and the other two normalizing variables in the logistic regression.</p>\n\n<p>The other concern that I have is that this approach takes each row independently from the others, and in theory, for each customer there should be only 0 or 1 tag A, 0 or 1 tag B and the remaining of them should be None (another tip is that normally Tag A and B are between first categories, because is highly dependent on the normalizing features (if days over total is High, there is a high possibility that the row is either A or B, depending on the Time Series Pattern). </p>\n\n<p>Edit: This is no longer a concern, I will just perform two different logistic regressions, one for Tag A or Other and another for Tag B or another, with the result probabilities I can select only the best of each.</p>\n\n<p>The dataset is enormous and the final algorithm needs to be applied using SQL (on Teradata), but for getting the coefficients of the logistic regression, or the centers of the clustering I get a sample and use R.</p>\n"

It stems from an essay to understand the powers and limitation of reinforcement learning as used in the AlphaGo program.</p>\n\n<p>The program AlphaGo has been built using, among other things (Monte-Carlo exploration of trees, etc.), neural networks which are trained from a huge database of human-played go games, and which are then reinforced by letting play versions of the program against itself many times.</p>\n\n<p>Now I wonder what would happen is we tried to build such a program without human database, i.e. starting with a basic program of Go just knowing rules and some method to explore trees, and letting play against itself to improve its neural network. Will we, after many games against itself, arrive at a program able to compete with or beat the best human players? And if so, how many games (in order of magnitude) would be needed for that? Or on the contrary, will such a program converge toward a much weaker player?</p>\n\n<p>I assume that the experiment has not been made, since AlphaGo is so recent. But the answer may nevertheless be obvious to a specialist. Otherwise any educated guess will interest me.</p>\n\n<p>One can also ask the same question for \"simpler\" games. If we use roughly the same reinforcement-learning technics used for AlphaGo, but with \nno use of human database, for a Chess program, would we eventually get\na program able to beat the best human? And if so, how fast? Has this been tried? Or if not for Chess, what about Checkers, or even simpler games? </p>\n\n<p>Thanks a lot.   </p>\n"

    "body": "<p>I'm building a remote-controlled self driving car for fun. I'm using a Raspberry Pi as the onboard computer; and I'm using various plug-ins, such as a Raspberry Pi camera and distance sensors, for feedback on the car's surroundings. I'm using OpenCV to turn the video frames into tensors, and I'm using Google's TensorFlow to build a convoluted neural network to learn road boundaries and obstacles. My main question is, should I use supervised learning to teach the car to drive or should I provide objectives and penalties and do reinforcement learning (i.e, get to point B as fast as possible while not hitting anything and staying within the road boundaries)? Below is a list of the pros and cons that I've come up with.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Supervised learning pros:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The inputs to the learning algorithm are pretty straightforward. The car learns to associate the video frame tensor and sensor distance readings with forward, backward, and angular wheel displacement</li>\n<li>I can more or less teach the car to drive exactly how I want (without overfitting, of course)</li>\n<li>I've done tons of supervised learning problems before, and this approach seems to comfortably fit my existing skill set</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Supervised learning cons:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It's not clear how to teach speed, and the correct speed is pretty arbitrary as long as the car doesn't go so fast that it veers off the road. I suppose I could drive fast during training, but this seems like a crude approach. Maybe I could manually add in a constant variable during training that corresponds to the speed for that training session, and then when the learning algorithm is deployed, I set this variable according to the speed I want? </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Reinforcement learning pros:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If I build my car with the specific purpose of racing other people's self driving cars, reinforcement learning seems to be the natural way to tell my car to \"get there as fast as possible\" </li>\n<li>I've read that RL is sometimes used for autonomous drones, so in theory it should be easier in cars because I don't have to worry about up and down</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Reinforcement learning cons:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>I feel like reinforcement learning would require a lot of additional sensors, and frankly my foot-long car doesn't have that much space inside considering that it also needs to fit a battery, the Raspberry Pi, and a breadboard</p></li>\n<li><p>The car will behave very erratically at first, so much so that maybe it destroys itself. It might also take an unreasonably long time to learn (e.g., months or years)</p></li>\n<li>I can't incoporate explicit rules later on, e.g., stop at a toy red-light. With supervised learning, I could incorporate numerous SL algorithms (e.g., a Haar Cascade classifier for identifying stoplights) into a configurable rules engine that gets evaluated between each video frame. The rules engine would thus be able to override the driving SL algorithm if it saw a red stoplight even though the stoplight might not have been part of the training of the driving algorithm. RL seems too continous to do this (ie., stop only at the terminal state)</li>\n<li>I don't have a lot experience with applied reinforcement learning, although I definitely want to learn it regardless</li>\n</ul>\n"

One feature is in the range $[0,10^6]$, another one in $[30,40]$ and there is one feature that mostly takes the value 8 and sometimes 7.

Is normalization also needed for decision forests? With Z-Score normalization, the different features of my test data do not lie in the same range. Could this be a problem? Should every feature normalized with the same algorithm, so that I decide either to use Min-Max for all features or Z-Score for all features?</p>\n\n<p>Are there combinations where the data is mapped to $[-1,1]$ and also has zero mean (which would imply a non-linear transformation of the data and hence a change in the variance and other features of the input data).</p>\n\n<p>I feel a bit lost because I can't find references which answer these questions.</p>\n"

I suspect, in industry projects, we want the results as quick as possible but produce the best performance. Are there any tips for reducing the training &amp; testing time? If you recommend subsetting the dataset, I will be interested to learn how best to subset the dataset to cover all or majority of scenarios from the dataset.</li>\n<li>We know that performing cross validation is better as it may reduce over-fitting. However, cross validation also takes time to train and the model trained with cross validation may not be implemented straight (speaking from python sklearn experience: I need to train the model with dataset again after cross validation testing for it to be implemented). Do you normally do cross validation in your big data projects or getting by with the train-test split?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Appreciate the feedback.  </p>\n"

The 2 main aspect I'm looking at are a graphviz representation of the tree and the list of feature importances.

FeatureA (0.300237)</p>\n\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><p>FeatureB (0.166800)</p></li>\n<li><p>FeatureC (0.092472)</p></li>\n<li><p>FeatureD (0.075009)</p></li>\n<li><p>FeatureE (0.068310)</p></li>\n<li><p>FeatureF (0.067118)</p></li>\n<li><p>FeatureG (0.066510)</p></li>\n<li><p>FeatureH (0.043502)</p></li>\n<li><p>FeatureI (0.040281)</p></li>\n<li><p>FeatureJ (0.039006)</p></li>\n<li><p>FeatureK (0.032618)</p></li>\n<li><p>FeatureL (0.008136)</p></li>\n<li><p>FeatureM (0.000000)</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>However, when I look at the top of the tree, it looks like this:<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/yJ2xy.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/yJ2xy.png\" alt=\"Tree Snippet\"></a></p>\n\n<p>In fact, some of the features that are ranked \"most important\" don't appear until much further down the tree, and the top of the tree is FeatureJ which is one of the lowest ranked features. My naive assumption would be that the most important features would be ranked near the top of the tree to have the greatest impact.

    "body": "<p>I would like to use ANNs for my problem, but the issue is my inputs and outputs node numbers are not fixed.</p>\n<p>I did some google searches before asking my question and found that the RNN may help me with my problem. But, all examples which I've found somehow have a <em>defined</em> number of input and output nodes.</p>\n<p>So, I'm looking for a strategy, how to make it real or at least some examples, preferable in Keras or PyTorch.</p>\n<p>More details about my issue:</p>\n<p>I have two inputs lists, where the length of the first one is fixed and equals two, e.g.:</p>\n<pre><code>in_1 = [2,2] \n</code></pre>\n<p>but the length of the second list is flexible, the length can be from three to inf, e.g.:</p>\n<pre><code>in_2 = [1,1,2,2]\n</code></pre>\n<p>or</p>\n<pre><code>in_2 = [1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Also, input lists depend on each other. The first list shows the dimension of the output list. So if in_1 = [2,2], means the output must have a possibility to be reshaped to [2,2] form.</p>\n<p>Currently, I'm thinking to combine two input list into one:</p>\n<pre><code>in = in_1 + in_2 = [2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Moreover, the output has the same length as the <strong>in_2</strong> list, e.g.:</p>\n<p>if input lists are:</p>\n<pre><code>in_1 = [2, 2]\nin_2 = [1, 1, 2, 2]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Output should be:</p>\n<pre><code>out = [1, 2, 1, 2]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Any ideas are welcome!</p>\n"

    "title": "How can autoencoders be used for clustering?",
    "body": "<p>Suppose I have a set of time-domain signals with absolutely <strong>no labels</strong>. I want to cluster them in 2 or 3 classes. Autoencoders are unsupervised networks that learn to compress the inputs. So given an input <span class=\"math-container\">$x^{(i)}$</span>, weights <span class=\"math-container\">$W_1$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\">$W_2$</span>, biases <span class=\"math-container\">$b_1$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\">$b_2$</span>, and output <span class=\"math-container\">$\\hat{x}^{(i)}$</span>, we can find the following relationships:</p>\n<p><span class=\"math-container\">$$z^{(i)} =W_1x^{(i)}+b_1$$</span>\n<span class=\"math-container\">$$\\hat{x}^{(i)} =W_2z^{(i)}+b_2$$</span></p>\n<p>So <span class=\"math-container\">$z^{(i)}$</span> would be a compressed form of <span class=\"math-container\">$x^{(i)}$</span>, and <span class=\"math-container\">$\\hat{x}^{(i)}$</span> the reconstruction of the latter. So far so good.</p>\n<p>What I don't understand is how this could be used for clustering (if there is any way to do it at all). For example, in the first figure of <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050917318707/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this paper</a>, there is a block diagram I'm not sure I understand. It uses the <span class=\"math-container\">$z^{(i)}$</span> as the inputs to the feed-forward network, but there is no mention to how that network is trained. I don't know if there is something I'm ignoring or if the paper is incomplete. Also, <a href=\"http://ufldl.stanford.edu/tutorial/unsupervised/Autoencoders/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this tutorial</a> at the end shows the weights learned by the autoencoder, and they seem to be kernels a CNN would learn to classify images. So... I guess the autoencoder's weights can be used somehow in a feed-forward network for classification, but I'm not sure how.</p>\n<p>My doubts are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If <span class=\"math-container\">$x^{(i)}$</span> is a time-domain signal of length <span class=\"math-container\">$N$</span> (i.e. <span class=\"math-container\">$x^{(i)}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{1\\times N}$</span>), can <span class=\"math-container\">$z^{(i)}$</span> only be a vector as well? In other words, would it make sense for <span class=\"math-container\">$z^{(i)}$</span> to be a <em>matrix</em> with one of its dimensions greater than <span class=\"math-container\">$1$</span>? I believe it would not, but I just want to check.</li>\n<li>Which of these quantities would be the input to a classifier? For example, if I want to use a classic MLP that has as many output units as classes I want to classify the signals in, what should I put at the input of this fully-connected network (<span class=\"math-container\">$z^{(i)}$</span>,<span class=\"math-container\">$\\hat{x}^{(i)}$</span>, any other thing)?</li>\n<li>How can I use the learned weights and biases in this MLP? Remember that we assumed that <strong>absolutely no labels</strong> are available, so it is impossible to train the network. I think the learned <span class=\"math-container\">$W_i$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\">$b_i$</span> should be useful somehow in the fully-connected network, but I don't see how to use them.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Observation: note that I used an MLP as an example because it is the most basic architecture, but the question applies to any other neural network that could be used to classify time-domain signals.</p>\n"

My <code>model.fit</code> looks like this :</p>\n<pre><code># Train the model\nhistory = model.fit(\n    x_train,\n    [y_11_train,y_22_train],\n    epochs=1, \n    batch_size=batch_size, \n    verbose=0, \n    shuffle=False)\n\nmodel.reset_states()\n</code></pre>\n<p>My model runs well and outputs results. But I am unable to increase or alter the <code>batch_size</code> as flexibly as we could do when the model is in stateless condition.\nAs in for bigger size of dataset the model seems to be training forever as the <code>batch_size</code> here is just 1. And as we know we can't randomly put any <code>batch_size</code> value for <code>stateful LSTM</code> as it needs to be a divisible factor.</p>\n<p>I have gone through some blogs which describes changing <code>batch_size</code> by using different batch sizes for training and predicting using the <code>get_weights()</code> and <code>set_weights()</code> functions in the Keras API ref: <a href=\"https://machinelearningmastery.com/use-different-batch-sizes-training-predicting-python-keras/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://machinelearningmastery.com/use-different-batch-sizes-training-predicting-python-keras/</a>, still it seems to be that the <code>batch_size</code> that is being used here is less.</p>\n<p>My question is : Cant we use batch size like 32, 64, 128 in stateful LSTMs? If yes then how do I implement it in my above given model, if not then what are the alternatives?</p>\n<p>Looking for valuable suggestions.</p>\n<p><strong>Post Edit</strong></p>\n<p>In stateful LSTM <code>model.reset_states()</code> should be after every epoch, Hence I set the resetting of the states after each epoch in the following way:</p>\n<pre><code>for i in range(100):\n    start = time.time()\n    history = model.fit(x_train, [y_11_train,y_22_train], epochs=1, batch_size=batch_size, verbose=0, shuffle=False)\n    model.reset_states()\n\n    print(&quot;Epoch&quot;,i, time.time()-start,&quot;s&quot;)\n</code></pre>\n"

    "body": "<p>From what I understand the Tree-Structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) creates two probability models based on hyperparameters that exceed the performance of some threshold and hyperparameters that don't. </p>\n\n<p>What I don't fully understand is why TPE is \"tree-structured.\" Is the simple clustering of y > thresh and y &lt; thresh sufficient to call it a \"tree?\" When I envision a \"tree structure\" I usually think of many different \"forks,\" perhaps some that are not binary and some that are forks of forks. Although a tree with just one fork is still technically a tree, the name \"Tree-Structured Parzen Estimator\" seems like it would describe something much more complex.</p>\n\n<p>My question is whether or not I am missing some other deeper conceptual \"forks\" inherent in TPE that would turn it into a \"tree\" when you look at the bigger picture.</p>\n"

    "body": "<p>I am seeking for a library/tool to visualize how social network changes when new nodes/edges are added to it.</p>\n\n<p>One of the existing solutions is <a href=\"http://www.stanford.edu/group/sonia/\">SoNIA: Social Network Image Animator</a>. It let's you make movies like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGSNCED6mDc\">this one</a>. </p>\n\n<p>SoNIA's documentation says that it's broken at the moment, and besides this I would prefer JavaScript-based solution instead. So, my question is: are you familiar with any tools or are you able to point me to some libraries which would make this task as easy as possible?</p>\n\n<p>Right after posting this question I'll dig into <a href=\"http://sigmajs.org/\">sigma.js</a>, so please consider this library covered.</p>\n\n<p>In general, my input data would be something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>time_elapsed; node1; node2\n1; A; B\n2; A; C\n3; B; C\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, here we have three points in time (1, 2, 3), three nodes (A, B, C), and three edges, which represent a triadic closure between the three considered nodes.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, every node will have two attributes (age and gender), so I would like to be able to change the shape/colour of the nodes.</p>\n\n<p>Also, after adding a new node, it would be perfect to have some ForceAtlas2 or similar algorithm to adjust the layout of the graph.</p>\n"

    "title": "Instances vs. cores when using EC2",
    "body": "<p>Working on what could often be called \"medium data\" projects, I've been able to parallelize my code (mostly for modeling and prediction in Python) on a single system across anywhere from 4 to 32 cores. Now I'm looking at scaling up to clusters on EC2 (probably with StarCluster/IPython, but open to other suggestions as well), and have been puzzled by how to reconcile distributing work across cores on an instance vs. instances on a cluster.</p>\n\n<p>Is it even practical to parallelize across instances as well as across cores on each instance? If so, can anyone give a quick rundown of the pros + cons of running many instances with few cores each vs. a few instances with many cores? Is there a rule of thumb for choosing the right ratio of instances to cores per instance? </p>\n\n<p>Bandwidth and RAM are non-trivial concerns in my projects, but it's easy to spot when those are the bottlenecks and readjust. It's much harder, I'd imagine, to benchmark the right mix of cores to instances without repeated testing, and my projects vary too much for any single test to apply to all circumstances. Thanks in advance, and if I've just failed to google this one properly, feel free to point me to the right answer somewhere else!</p>\n"

Of course, aside from the obvious one, that Hadoop (processing via MapReduce in a Hadoop Cluster) is a batch processing system, and Storm is a real-time processing system.</p>\n\n<p>I have worked a bit with Hadoop Eco System, but I haven't worked with Storm. After looking through a lot of presentations and articles, I still haven't been able to find a satisfactory and comprehensive answer.</p>\n\n<p>Note: The term tradeoff here is not meant to compare to similar things.
